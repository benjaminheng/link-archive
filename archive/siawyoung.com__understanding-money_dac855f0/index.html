<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22573204">Ask HN</a> came up recently,
asking for recommendations for resources on understanding money. I gave it a few
days before diving in to collate all of the recommendations. For additional
information about any of the items on the list, feel free to search for keywords
on the Hacker News webpage itself.</p>
<p>These are sorted in order of appearance, from top to bottom, which I believe is
a rough estimate of quality. Many items on the list have also been recommended
more than once.</p>
<p>Note that I have not read or watched most of these recommendations, so I cannot
offer any personal commentary. I will, however, be pulling some of these into my own
<a href="https://siawyoung.com/library">reading queue</a>, so feel free to check that out.</p>
