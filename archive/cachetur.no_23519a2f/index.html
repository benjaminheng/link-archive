<p>Cachetur.no is a trip planning tool for geocachers (you still have to plan the trips yourself). Cachetur.no is not a personal geocaching database tool (like GSAK). If a trip planner is what you&#39;re looking for, and you haven&#39;t already registered, <a href="https://cachetur.no/registrer">sign up here!</a></p>
<p>It is entirely free to create an account and use cachetur.no, but you must have an account at <a href="https://geocaching.com">geocaching.com</a> before you can use cachetur.no.</p>
<p>To take full advantage of cachetur.no, you need to be a premium member at geocaching.com.</p>
