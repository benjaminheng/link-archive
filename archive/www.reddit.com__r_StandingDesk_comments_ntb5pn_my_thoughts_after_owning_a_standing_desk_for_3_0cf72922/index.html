    In February, after lurking around this subreddit and consuming every YouTube video under the sun, I built this standing desk. I used the cheapest electric frame with memory buttons that I could find, and combined it with a kitchen counter top, for a total cost of £232 (approx $328).

    Thinking back to before I built this, these were some of my concerns:
  </p><ol>
      <li>
    <p>
    Do I really need a standing desk? What is the science behind them?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    What are my options? £ to £££
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    What&#39;s the best option?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    What accessories should I buy?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    What are the drawbacks?
  </p>
  </li>
    </ol><p>
    Let&#39;s tackle each of these in turn. If you can&#39;t be bothered reading this, here&#39;s a video where I explain the same thoughts (and also show my desk in more detail).
  </p><p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv5zDRZrBDk" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv5zDRZrBDk</a>
  </p><p>
    You may have seen standing desk companies make some pretty bold marketing claims.
  </p><p>
    In perhaps the first ever application of my undergrad research skills, I thought I would dive into Google Scholar to see what studies about standing desks actually say.
  </p><p>
    On health:
  </p><p>
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-012-2677-z" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">It is pretty clear</a> excessive sitting is bad for you. There are links between excessive sitting and a whole range of bad health effects, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and ultimately, premature death.
  </p><p>
    But do standing desks actually address this? i.e. will you actually stand up more?
  </p><p>
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD010912.pub5" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">This study</a> found that introducing standing desks in the workplace did reduce sitting time. After 3 months, sitting reduced by an average of 100 minutes per workday for each employee. After 12 months, this average had gone down to 57 minutes per day. We stand up more with standing desks, but the amount of standing we do seems to reduce over time.
  </p><p>
    The way I see it, 57 minutes is still better than 0.
  </p><p>
    Note - Having a standing desk won&#39;t actually help you burn more calories - for example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2015-0419" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">this study</a> found that:
  </p><ul>
      <li>
    <p>
    While sitting, people burned an average of 80 calories/hour.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    While standing, people burned 88 calories/hour.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    For comparison, walking burned 210 calories/hour.
  </p>
  </li>
    </ul><p>
    Mortality rates tend to go down with less sitting, but this does not correspond to how many calories you burn. If you want to burn more calories, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re actually gonna have to leave your desk. God forbid, go outside.
  </p><p>
    There are studies that claim a range of other benefits, like reducing stress and improving overall mood. But meta-analyses generally say that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.11.011" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">the evidence base is pretty poor</a> - the studies that do exist are generally low quality. The truth is, we don&#39;t know that much about whether standing desks are worth it.
  </p><p>
    Also, we don&#39;t want to stand up too much. There are lots of jobs, for example in retail, food, healthcare and education, where people stand up for the majority of the time. But we don&#39;t hear about the health benefits of working these jobs.
  </p><p>
    <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2016-096795" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">This review of 50 studies</a> found that there were associations between occupational standing and musculoskeletal symptoms, especially lower back problems. We don&#39;t know what the optimum amount of standing vs. sitting time is, but it&#39;s not as simple as the more standing the better. Standing for, say, over four hours per day at work may have negative consequences.
  </p><p>
    On productivity:
  </p><p>
    Standing desks will NOT make you more productive. I can personally vouch for this, I still procrastinate as much as ever, but the evidence also seems to conclude the same.
  </p><p>
    <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2015.12.003" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">This study in a call centre</a> found that standing desks led to no difference in productivity.
  </p><p>
    A few studies like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103306" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">this one</a> even say that your concentration is worse while standing, because you are using brain resources to control your back and legs, so you have less attention to allocate to your work.
  </p><p>
    On this basis, you might be wondering, what swayed it for me to buy a standing desk?
  </p><p>
    Well, they&#39;re really cool. Take that, science.
  </p><p>
    Free - Stand up and walk around, instead of spending hundreds on a desk. Fair point, but to carry on working, you have to sit down again. That&#39;s why this study found no significant effects on sitting time when more walking was encouraged in the workplace. Also you can&#39;t show off to your friends about this, unlike when you own a standing desk.

    Both of these allow you to stand up, but are super inconvenient, because they vastly reduce the amount of space on your desk. I say you should buy a new desk altogether, that you can adjust between sitting and standing.
  </p><p>
    Manual adjustment desks:
  </p><p>
    £££ Hand crank desk - Watch any video of this on YouTube - it takes forever to adjust them.
  </p><p>
    £££ Gas lift desk - Much faster than the hand crank. But they can typically hold a maximum weight of around 15kg. If you have more than this on your desk (pretty likely since table tops often weigh this much alone), when you want to stand up, you have to lift the excess weight yourself. That&#39;s a lot of bicep curls. If you have less than 15kg, you have to push the difference down when you want to sit down. That&#39;s a lot of tricep extensions. If you want the gains, fair enough. But you might as well save yourself the manual labour, and get an electric desk. It doesn&#39;t cost that much more.
  </p><p>
    Electric desks:
  </p><p>
    ££££ Desks with up/down buttons only - The cheapest electric desks you can buy. I didn&#39;t go for one of these, because very time you adjust the desk, you have to hold the button for the entire time the desk is moving.

      </a>
    
  </figure><p>
    The main problem with hand crank, gas lift and up/down only desks is that, in every adjustment, you have to guess the preferred sitting/standing heights you had your desk at before. So why not fork out a little more for..
  </p><p>
    £££££ Desks with memory - These desks come with 3/4 memory slots, so you can allocate one button to your sitting height and one to your standing height.

      </a>
    
  </figure><p>
    ££££££ Fancy desks - The higher end standing desks have memory functions, but also have:
  </p><p>
    Two motors instead of one - Dual motor desks move faster, but also more quietly, because each individual motor doesn&#39;t have to lift the whole desk.
  </p><p>
    Three stage legs instead of two stage - This allows you to have a greater range of heights. Could be useful for any particularly short/tall kings.
  </p><p>
    Anti-collision system - The desk will stop moving as soon as it hits an obstacle, rather than trying to power on through.
  </p><p>
    C-frame - The legs are located towards the back of the desk, rather than in the middle (a T-frame). This can give you a little more space, and if you want to insert a stability crossbar to reduce wobble, it means that the bar won&#39;t restrict your leg room as much.
  </p><p>
    My standing desk frame is the cheapest one I could find with memory buttons, which happened to be from a brand called Allcam on ebay. It cost £199 at the time (but I have seen cheaper since).
  </p><p>
    I think this type of desk is the best balance of price with functionality. For example, dual motor might be faster and quieter, but having owned my desk for 3 months, I have not once thought &#34;this is quite slow&#34; or &#34;it&#39;s too loud&#34;.
  </p><p>
    How did I choose between all the brands out there? I felt pretty exhausted looking at all the different ones e.g. flexispot, autonomous, fully, uplift, ikea, etc.
  </p><p>
    I discovered while reading this subreddit, and some articles on <a href="http://workwhilewalking.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">workwhilewalking.com</a> that lots of the standing desk brands all use the same few Chinese suppliers. For example, from <a href="https://www.workwhilewalking.com/jiecang-electric-standing-desk-base-review" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">this article</a>:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p>
    The Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Company of Zhiejang, China, is one of the long-time producers of electric standing desk bases, used more than any other base by popular online sellers of standing desks, including GeekDesk, S2S (sold by Ergoprise), Jarvis (sold by Fully) and UpLift (sold by TheHumanSolution) to name but a few.
  </p>
  </blockquote><p>
    So pretty much all of the single motor standing desks, despite the different brands, are literally the same thing. Also there is a lot of astroturf marketing, where these companies pay customers to write positive reviews as if they were independent. If you go on these companies&#39; websites, the reviews don&#39;t tend to be very useful. For example look on the autonomous website - every product happens to be rated exactly 5 stars.
  </p><p>
    On this basis, you might as well go for the cheapest frame you can find. All these brand names, like on Amazon - flexispot, alldrei, maidesite etc. - are pretty much meaningless. None of them actually manufacture their own desks, they just buy them from the same supplier.
  </p><p>
    On table tops, I would firstly say buy your table top separately from the desk frame, because this usually works out cheaper.
  </p><p>
    The cheapest new table top by far is the IKEA Linnmon, which costs around £15, but can go down to £7 if you want 100cmx60cm.
  </p><p>
    The only reason I didn&#39;t buy a Linnmon was that I needed one in specific dimensions for my room. You can&#39;t cut up an IKEA table top to size, because the inside is literally just air and cardboard.
  </p><p>
    I actually ending up buying a kitchen counter top from my local timber shop for £54. Yes, a kitchen counter top. Hear me out on this:
  </p><p>
    Aesthetics - The texture options on kitchen counter tops seem to be so much more varied than normal table tops. I managed to find one in a nice walnut texture, but there are so many other options available. It&#39;s not real wood (or marble or stone etc.), it&#39;s just laminate bonded to some particleboard. But if you were buying a genuine walnut table top it would cost a lot more.
  </p><p>
    Cut to size - A key advantage over the IKEA table tops. My kitchen counter top was actually 3 metres long originally, so I got my timber shop to cut it in half. This left me with two desktops rather than one, so I sold the other one on ebay for £20, leaving my desk top costing £34.
  </p><p>
    Heat/water resistance - They are made for kitchens after all. So you can eat and drink at your desk guilt-free.
  </p><p>
    The only disadvantage of kitchen counter tops over solid wooden table tops is that you have to glue on the edges yourself. You get a length of edging strip which you have to cut up, line up with the grain, glue on, and file away the excess. The last step was pretty damn hard to do without making scratches, but these scratches are nothing you would notice day-to-day.
  </p><p>
    I&#39;ve put these in order of how essential they are to the cheapskate setup:
  </p><ol>
      <li>
    <p>
    Drawers - Standing desks don&#39;t come with drawers, because the legs need to move. Most drawers and filing cabinets are too tall to fit underneath the frame, but a cheap one that does is the IKEA Helmer, which costs £29. It&#39;s metal, so I think it looks pretty neat next to the metal legs.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Monitor - If you work from a laptop, adding literally any monitor will change your life. Especially if you&#39;re just using it for work, you don&#39;t need a 24 inch LED 120Hz monitor. Mine is an old 19 inch LCD monitor, which you can get for like £20 on ebay, and it connects to my laptop via VGA cable. Being able to have two full size windows up at the same time is super helpful while working. Also, now you have a nice additional monitor, get a background befitting of it. <a href="https://unsplash.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> is a website with super cool stock photos available for free, and if you use the &#39;span&#39; setting on Windows you can have a nice panorama shot stretch over both screens.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Monitor Arm - Monitor arms make it much easier to move your screen around if you need to get behind your desk, and free up a ton of space underneath it, but crucially, they help with posture. You can mount a monitor much higher than you can with its original stand, so when you&#39;re sat at your desk, or stood at your desk, the monitor is much closer to eye level. In terms of choosing your monitor arm, the same principle applies from the desk frames. They&#39;re all basically the same, so just pick the cheapest one, I picked one by Bontec from Amazon for £35. It was the cheapest one that came with a laptop tray, so I could mount my monitor directly next to my laptop, which looks super neat. It just clamps to the edge of the desk and you attach the monitor and tray using its VESA mount holes.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Keyboard and Mouse - Because your laptop is now floating, you&#39;re gonna need a separate keyboard and mouse. I literally bought the cheapest ones I could find - a keyboard and mouse for £9.99. We&#39;re not on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards</a>, so it&#39;s okay.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Cable management<br/>Without some form of cable management, your cables will be all over the place, and it&#39;s especially obvious when the desk is in the standing position. They dangle around everywhere. I solved it by using:
  </p><ol>
      <li>
    <p>
    Extension lead - Don&#39;t just leave it on the floor, mount it under the table top. Most extension leads have holes in the back to accommodate hooks, so I found two scraps of wood lying around the house, screwed these into the table top, and mounted the extension lead to them (scroll up and watch my video for what this looks like). Now, when the desk is moving, the only cable that moves is the one running from the extension lead to the wall. Very aesthetic. If you&#39;re buying a new extension lead, make sure the entry point is on the correct side - strangely most extension lead cables come in from the right here in the UK.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Cable management trunking - The cable management setup is completed by an IKEA signum tray which costs £10. I chuck in all my cables running to the laptop and monitor, so they&#39;re not dangling around and hitting my legs.
  </p>
  </li>
    </ol>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Phone clamp - I use a phone clamp to mount my phone above my laptop, which lets me use it as a webcam.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Phone stand - I use a £4 Sigfinn phone stand from IKEA. Not really necessary, but it&#39;s somewhere to put my phone, and because it has a slot in the bottom for a cable, I can stand it up while charging.

    Wobble - My desk is pretty wobbly in the standing position, which took some getting used to. You can type perfectly fine, but I can&#39;t say it&#39;s as stable as a normal sitting desk. You can buy a stability crossbar which sits across the middle of the frame as I mentioned before, but for T-frame desks like mine they really get in the way of your legroom and prevent you from putting things like a set of drawers underneath. So I just live with the wobble.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    No anti-collision system - Cheaper desk frames like mine don&#39;t have an anti-collision system. I&#39;ve had some pretty near misses where I had to swipe something away just before my desk obliterated it (or got obliterated). Keeps me on my toes I guess (no pun intended).
  </p>

    Warranty - especially with the cheaper standing desk companies, it seems like if your desk stops working then you&#39;re basically on your own. Luckily for me my desk is still working, but I&#39;m not really sure what I&#39;ll do if it breaks. I guess it&#39;ll just be a sitting desk again.
  </p>
  </li>
    </ol><p>
    Other complaints like the desk being too loud or too slow really haven&#39;t been concerns for me. I would say don&#39;t buy a more expensive one just for those reasons. Overall, none of these drawbacks make me regret buying my desk, I would 100% do it again.
  </p><p>
    Desk alone - £232
  </p><p>
    With accessories - £355.99
  </p><p>
    Paying three figures for a desk would probably make my 18-year-old self gouge his eyes out, but for what you get, this is the cheapest good standing desk out there.
  </p><p>
    After 3 months, I still use my desk in both positions every day. Even though the science isn&#39;t completely conclusive, I do feel healthier in myself from standing up more. Plus, being able to change position is nice for breaking up the monotony of working for long periods.

    Watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv5zDRZrBDk" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">video</a> about it.
  </p><p>
    <em>Do I really need a standing desk? What is the science behind them?</em>
  </p><p>
    No. The scientific evidence isn&#39;t very extensive at the moment (you could say, like most standing desks, it&#39;s pretty wobbly). On the other hand, these desks are extremely cool.
  </p><p>
    <em>What&#39;s the best option?</em>
  </p><p>
    The cheapest single-motor desk with memory buttons that you can find on Amazon/eBay (try to ignore the marketing as much as you can), combined with an IKEA Linnmon/kitchen counter top. Approx. cost is £230 ($325).
  </p><p>
    <em>What accessories should I buy?</em>
  </p><p>
    IKEA Helmer drawers (most don&#39;t fit underneath the frame), monitor arm (with laptop tray if you work from a laptop), IKEA signum cable management.
  </p><p>
    <em>What are the drawbacks of standing desks?</em>
  </p><p>
    Wobble - but you will get used to it.
  </p><p>
    Warranty - if your desk stops working, you are probably in for an uphill battle. But what&#39;s life without a little risk.
  </p><p>
    <em>Will I regret buying a standing desk?</em>
  </p><p>
    After owning mine for three months, I don&#39;t. I say <strong>go for it.</strong>
