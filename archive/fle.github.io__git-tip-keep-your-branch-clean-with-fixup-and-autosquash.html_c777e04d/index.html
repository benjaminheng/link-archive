		<p>Who is not tired of committing a &#34;Remove pdb&#34; or a &#34;Fix a typo&#34; few minutes or hours after committing a clean feature ? A few time ago, I discovered two useful options in GIT that work together : <tt>git commit <span>--fixup</span></tt> and <tt>git rebase <span>--autosquash</span></tt>. With these, you can easily merge little fixes with the original feature and keep your branch clean.</p>
<p>Preferably, you won&#39;t use it in a stable or master branch, because rebase rewrites history and can create a big mess, mainly if project counts several developers. It rather can be convenient to clean a development branch before merging it in master.</p>
<div id="fixup-autosquash">
<h2>--fixup &amp; --autosquash</h2>
<ul>
<li><tt>git commit <span>--fixup</span> &lt;commit&gt;</tt> automatically marks your commit as a fix of a previous commit</li>
<li><tt>git rebase <span>-i</span> <span>--autosquash</span></tt> automatically organize merging of these fixup commits and associated normal commits</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Take a git repos with a branch <cite>dev</cite>. You intend to commit features A and B:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git add featureA
<span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git commit -m <span>&#34;Feature A is done&#34;</span>
<span>[dev fb2f677] Feature A is done</span>
<span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git add featureB
<span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git commit -m <span>&#34;Feature B is done&#34;</span>
<span>[dev 733e2ff] Feature B is done</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Your work is in progress and you find minor mistakes in Feature A : it&#39;s time to use <tt><span>--fixup</span></tt> option !</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git add featureA                <span># you&#39;ve removed a pdb : shameful commit</span>
<span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git commit --fixup fb2f677
<span>[dev c5069d5] fixup! Feature A is done</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here, you see that GIT automatically retrieved featureA commit message prefixed by fixup!.</p>
<p>All work is done, let&#39;s see the log:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git log --oneline
<span>c5069d5 fixup! Feature A is done</span>
<span>733e2ff Feature B is done</span>
<span>fb2f677 Feature A is done</span>
<span>ac5db87 Previous commit</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, you want to clean your branch before merging it : it&#39;s time to use <tt><span>--autosquash</span></tt> option !</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git rebase -i --autosquash ac5db87
<span>pick fb2f677 Feature A is done</span>
<span>fixup c5069d5 fixup! Feature A is done</span>
<span>fixup c9e138f fixup! Feature A is done</span>
<span>pick 733e2ff Feature B is done</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This command has opened your editor with lines above. Just save &amp; quit and ... :</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> <span>(</span>dev<span>)</span> git log --oneline
<span>ff4de2a Feature B is done</span>
<span>5478cee Feature A is done</span>
<span>ac5db87 Previous commit</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Your shameful commit has been merged properly with the original feature. It&#39;s just a shorcut for something you could do otherwise but I find it very convenient :).</p>
<p>That&#39;s all folks !</p>
<p>EDIT : <tt>git rebase i <span>&lt;after-this-commit&gt;</span></tt> must be launched with as argument <cite>the last commit you want to retain as-is</cite>, not the first one you want to change.</p>
