  <p>Recently I’ve set up a knowledge base to document any learnings or interesting resources I come across. It is accessible at <a href="https://kb.hbenjamin.com">https://kb.hbenjamin.com</a>. In this post I describe my knowledge base workflow and the tooling I’ve built around it.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a href="#requirements" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>On storage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Must be stored in plain text.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On reading:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Must be readable in plain text.</li>
<li>Must be viewable from a web browser on mobile or desktop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On editing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Must be editable with a simple text editor.</li>
<li>Must be editable from a web browser on desktop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On discovery:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Must be searchable from the terminal.</li>
<li>Must be searchable from vim.</li>
<li>May be searchable from the web browser. (Optional)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-choices"><a href="#design-choices" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Design choices</h2>
<h3 id="discovery-search-over-categorization"><a href="#discovery-search-over-categorization" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Discovery: search over categorization</h3>
<p>I focused on search over categorization as the primary discovery mechanism. While I do organize entries into sub-directories, I’ve opted not to do tagging for now. As the number of entries grow I might consider having a more thorough taxinomy.</p>
<h3 id="file-format"><a href="#file-format" arialabel="Anchor"></a>File format</h3>
<p>Each entry is written in markdown. Markdown is generally readable, moreso if using an editor with syntax highlighting. It being a plaintext file format means that it will always remain readable in the future.</p>
<h3 id="versioning"><a href="#versioning" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Versioning</h3>
<p>The knowledge base is versioned using git. The only concern I have is if
I’ll have a need for binary files in the future. It’s plausible that I might want to store PDF files for instance. I’ll reconsider my storage choice if the number of binary files happens to grow large enough.</p>
<h3 id="web-tech-stack"><a href="#web-tech-stack" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Web tech stack</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hugo as the static site generator: Each knowledge base entry is essentially a post.</li>
<li>Netlify for web hosting and automatic deployments.</li>
<li>NetlifyCMS for editing content through a web browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve had good experiences using this stack for my personal site, so it makes sense to do the same for my knowledge base.</p>
<h2 id="directory-structure-and-content"><a href="#directory-structure-and-content" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Directory structure and content</h2>
<p>Here’s a snippet of my directory structure at this time:</p>
<pre><code>content/
  climbing/
    _index.md
    trips.md
  tech/
    docker.md
    elasticsearch.md
    postgres.md
    pprof.md
  fitness.md
  travel.md
</code></pre><p>Here’s a snippet of what an entry might contain:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="markdown">---

<span>## Injuries

<span>-</span> [<span>Crimpd app</span>](<span>https://www.crimpd.com/</span>). Climbing specific exercises and training routines, on and off the wall.
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see there’s nothing particularly special about how entries are represented. Plain markdown with optional YAML frontmatter. I can write and publish these posts from anywhere, including mobile.</p>

<p>A command-line program to manage and navigate my knowledge base. Written in Go,
the source can be found at
<a href="https://github.com/benjaminheng/kb">github.com/benjaminheng/kb</a>. <code>kb</code> requires
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> for fuzzy navigation.</p>
<p>Install using:</p>
<pre><code>go get -u github.com/benjaminheng/kb
</code></pre><h3 id="browsing-files"><a href="#browsing-files" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Browsing files</h3>
<p>Invoking <code>kb</code> without any arguments spawns a fzf finder for jumping to a
particular file. Typically this is the most common way I interact with my
knowledge base. Selecting a file opens it in vim (or your choice of editor).</p>
<pre><code>  pprof reference :: /Users/benh/dev/knowledge-base/tech/pprof.md
  PostgreSQL :: /Users/benh/dev/knowledge-base/tech/postgres.md
  Elasticsearch :: /Users/benh/dev/knowledge-base/tech/elasticsearch.md
  Docker :: /Users/benh/dev/knowledge-base/tech/docker.md

&gt;
</code></pre><h3 id="performing-git-operations"><a href="#performing-git-operations" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Performing git operations</h3>
<pre><code>$ kb git --help
Performs git operations on the knowledge base

Usage:
  kb git [command]

Available Commands:
  pull        Pulls changes from remote
  push        Pushes changes to remote
  status      Shows working tree status
</code></pre><p>Since my knowledge base is versioned using Git, I wanted a way to quickly
perform common Git operations without having to switch working directories and
execute git commands manually. I’ve implemented three common operations: pull,
push, and status.</p>
<p>The commands <code>pull</code> and <code>status</code> are fairly self-explanatory; the former
invokes <code>git pull</code> and the latter <code>git status</code>.</p>
<p>However the <code>push</code> command is a composition of several git commands to make my
life easier.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>git ls-files --others --modified</code> to check if there are files to commit. If none, then do <code>git status</code> and exit.</li>
<li><code>git add .</code> to stage changes or new files.</li>
<li><code>git status</code> to provide user feedback on what will be commited.</li>
<li>Prompt for user confirmation. If no confirmation, do <code>git reset .</code> and exit.</li>
<li>Prompt the user for a commit message. (default: “Update &lt;filename&gt;&#34;)</li>
<li><code>git commit -m &#34;&lt;commitmessage&gt;&#34;</code> to create a commit.</li>
<li><code>git push</code> to push changes upstream.</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result is that after making a change to a file and invoking <code>kb git push</code>, the command will automatically push my changes upstream with minimal
effort on my part.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m quite happy with the solution I’ve ended up with. The knowledge base being available through a web browser is a surprisingly important feature. It being easily accessible has led to me updating it more often.</p>
<p>As for the tooling, it does what I want for the moment. My terminal workflow is to use <code>kb</code> to open the selected file in vim, then use my vim setup for further search and filters. It’s quite an efficient setup, given my familiarity with vim for code navigation.</p>
<p>Overall I had anticipated things being more complicated. However as I made progress, I found that many features I envisioned we simply not needed, or were simpler to implement that expected. Using Hugo, rendering the knowledge base into a website was a piece of cake. Netlify  made the web deployment trivial, and NetlifyCMS took care of web editing. The tooling was simpler than expected as well; I found that I could delegate the bulk of code navigation to vim.</p>
