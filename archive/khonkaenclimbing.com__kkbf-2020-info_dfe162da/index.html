				<div data-id="4bb990c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><p>Join us for KKBF2020 during 18-19 Jan 2020.</p><p>Having a limited number of carshpads available and manpower and because we want to make sure you have a pleasant time climbing with us,<br/>the number of participants to the KKBF 2019 is limited to 100 climbing participants and 50 observers.</p><h3><strong>1. OVERVIEW</strong></h3><p>Mad Rocks presents Khon Kaen International  Bouldering Festival 2020 (#KKBF2020), organized by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/khonkaenclimbingclub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khon Kaen Climbing Club</a> (KKCC). We are a group of local and international climbers united by passion for climbing and the development of climbing in Khon Kaen. <strong>Proceeds from ticket sales and money raised from the festival will go toward climbing fund in Khon Kaen.</strong></p><p>This year, the festival takes place at Zoolander bouldering area, a new area at the Khon Kaen Zoo, in Khon Kaen province, Northeastern Thailand.  We are authorized by the Zoo Organization to host KKBF2020 at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zkfaKsYdta52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khon Kaen Zoo</a>. Not only animal exhibits and wildlife conservation research center of rare breeds, the zoo is also a place that has hundreds of sandstone boulders with great potential of nearly a thounsand lines to climb. We hope that this area will soon become an international bouldering destination. KKBF2020 is intended to be better than ever, shorter duration but more effectively organized, with new areas, new problems and more participants! With the help of our sponsors, our festival will bring more than 100 climbers to Zoolander for a 2-days 1-nights of climbing, camping, adventure, fun, challenges and friendship. Our goal is to make Zoolander a climbing destination in Southeast Asia, offering a platform for meeting, learning and sharing climbing experiences and the outdoor activities.</p></div>

You can register for ‘fun climb’ to use our topo and crash pad and do not have to compete with anyone. ‘Fun climb’ category will be a little cheaper as you don’t get a festival booket and prize.<br/>– <strong>Registration Saturday morning</strong>, just before you climb. During KKBF2019, we had a registration Friday night and those who decided to skip that missed a lot of essential information they need to know to climb at Zoolander.<br/>– Effective way to <strong>indentify a boulder</strong>. We will continue to use 27crags to po, but we will definely put a sign near/on the boulder to let you know which boulder you are climbing on.<br/>– Just <strong>one comp catagory</strong>. No more ‘semi-pro’ nor ‘recreational’ with different grade to climb…. just one open competition. Simple and easy.<br/>– More <strong>healthly food</strong>. We will add more green and fruit to our menu 🙂<br/>– No more long and <strong>borring raffle</strong>. We will still have prize for the lucky one using ‘soi-dao’ which means you come catching a lucky star by yourself.<br/>– <strong>Live music</strong>. It’s a festival y’all. We’ll get you the best live singer from Khon Kaen city to sing for us at KKBF2020.<b></b></p><h3>2.<b>KKBF 2020 SCHEDULE</b></h3><p><b>Saturday – 18 Jan, 2020</b><br/><b>7:30 AM</b> Meeting for KKBF transportation at <a href="http://www.kosahotel.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kosa Hotel</a>.
