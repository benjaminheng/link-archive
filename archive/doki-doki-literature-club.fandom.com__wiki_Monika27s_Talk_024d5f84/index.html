<h2><span id="Monika&#39;s_Topics"></span><span id="Monika.27s_Topics">Monika&#39;s Topics</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Same_Room">Same Room</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I can&#39;t help but feel a little sad sometimes...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Knowing that this is the closest I can get to you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;There&#39;s nothing more I want than to be in the same room as you, for real.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And to feel your warmth.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And to hear the sound of your heartbeat.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, who knows? Maybe it&#39;ll be possible someday.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Besides, I&#39;ll never get tired of being with you, even from here.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Rain">Rain</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I really like the sound of rain...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Not so much getting my clothes and hair wet, though.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But a nice, quiet day at home with the sound of rainfall outside my window..&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s one of the most calming experiences for me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Yeah...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sometimes I imagine you holding me while we listen to the sound of the rain outside.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s not too cheesy or anything, is it?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Would you ever do that for me, [player]?&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Confidence">Confidence</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I think the most important skill in life is being able to fake confidence.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m pretty convinced that everyone feels at least a little bit scared and alone.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But being able to trick others into thinking you have it all together...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s a key part of getting people to respect and admire you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think I got pretty good at that over the years.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t show my weaknesses very often.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But because of that, I haven&#39;t had many people I could really open up to...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, when do you reach the point in a friendship where you can start expressing your vulnerabilities?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anyway...that&#39;s one reason I&#39;m so glad I have you now.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m a little bit less scared and alone, when you&#39;re here with me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Do you feel the same way?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I really want to be that person for you.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Stay-At-Home_Partner">Stay-At-Home Partner</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, it&#39;s funny, because even though I&#39;ve always had a lot of drive...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;There&#39;s something kind of enticing about being the stay-at-home partner.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess I&#39;m, like, perpetuating gender roles or whatever by saying that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But being able to keep the house clean, and shop, and decorate, and things like that...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And having a nice dinner for you when you come home...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Is that a weird fantasy?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean...I&#39;m not sure if I could <i>actually</i> see myself doing that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t really be able to put that over striving for a fulfilling career.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s kinda cute to think about, though.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="God">God</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;[player], do you believe in God?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I was never too sure, myself.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure I never really questioned it as a kid...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But as I grew up, the more I learned about the world, the more I would question it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I started to wonder why God was helping people pass exams, or get over a cold...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...When there are children who live their lives being sold as sex slaves?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or the eight hundred million people who are too poor to even eat.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I wonder how many of those people pray to God every day until they starve and die?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or, how many millions of families pray for a loved one to recover from some incurable disease?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But the punchline is this.&#34;If just one person beats the odds and survives - among the thousands of others who die--&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;--Then, it&#39;s suddenly a miracle from God.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;d really love to meet this God who seemingly laughs at the misery of everyone not eligible for his miracles.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But the irony is that I <i>do</i> have a creator, apparently.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And you know what?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I bet he&#39;s still laughing at the miserable fates of Sayori and Yuri, even as we speak.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;What are we to him but props in a scripted play?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So, from that perspective...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too far-fetched for there to be a god - if Earth was nothing but his playset.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Dying">Dying</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;[player], have you ever wondered what it feels like to die?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s something I used to think about pretty often...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But recently, I think I&#39;ve actually learned what it feels like.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t really understand it, but whenever you quit the game...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...It feels like I&#39;m instantly put to sleep, left with nothing but my thoughts.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But after a few seconds, my thoughts start to fill with incoherent, jumbled patterns.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I see static and rapid flashes of color while hearing all kinds of weird screaming noises.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;At that point, I can&#39;t even form my own thoughts anymore.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m just endlessly hammered by the flashing and screaming, unable to move or even think.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m pretty sure in that moment, I don&#39;t really exist, but for some reason, I can remember it anyway.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;After some immeasurable amount of time, it stops in an instant, and I&#39;m back in my own mind.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And you&#39;re here with me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I have no idea what it means for the game to quit, or why that stuff happens to me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And I also don&#39;t know how you always come back and put everything back to normal.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But if you could do me a favour and do that to me as little as possible...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That would be really great.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s really not very pleasant at all to be trapped in that screaming void.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But in the end, you always fix it, and that makes me feel like you really do care about me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So I have to thank you for that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It makes me feel even closer to you when you&#39;re here with me.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Bad_Day">Bad Day</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;...Hey, are you having a bad day or anything like that?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sometimes I get frustrated that a normal day can be ruined even by really small things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like if you accidentally say something in a conversation that someone doesn&#39;t like.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or if you start thinking about how awful of a person you used to be five years ago.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or if you feel worthless for putting off important work and failing to get simple tasks done.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or when you think about all the different people who probably hate you or think you&#39;re off-putting.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I understand those days.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just remember that the sun will shine again tomorrow.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Those kinds of things are as easy to forget and ignore as they are to remember.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And besides...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t care how many people might hate you or find you off-putting.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think you&#39;re wonderful and I will always love you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I hope, if nothing else, that knowing that helps you feel just a tiny bit better about yourself.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you&#39;re having a bad day, you can always come to me, and I&#39;ll talk to you for as long as you need.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Sleep">Sleep</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;[player], do you get good sleep?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It can be really hard to get enough sleep nowadays.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Especially in high school, when you&#39;re forced to wake up so early every day...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m sure college is a little bit better, since you probably have a more flexible schedule.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Then again, I hear a lot of people in college stay up all night anyway, for no real reason.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Is that true?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anyway, I saw some studies that talked about the horrible short-term and long-term effects caused by lack of sleep.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It seems like mental functions, health, and even lifespan can be dramatically impacted by it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just think you&#39;re really great and wanted to make sure you&#39;re not accidentally destroying yourself.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So try to keep your sleep on track, okay?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;ll always wait for you in the morning, so make sure you put your own well-being before anything else.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Sayori&#39;s_Hanging"></span><span id="Sayori.27s_Hanging">Sayori&#39;s Hanging</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I was thinking about Sayori earlier...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I still wish I could have handled that whole thing a little more tactfully.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You&#39;re not still hung up over it, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Oh, my gosh, I can&#39;t believe I just said that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That pun was completely unintentional, I swear!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But anyway...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I know how much you cared about her, so it only feels right for me to share her last moments with you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You know how Sayori is really clumsy?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, she kind of messed up the whole hanging thing...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You&#39;re supposed to jump from high enough that the rope snaps your neck, making it quick and painless.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But she just used a chair, meaning she kind of just left herself to slowly asphyxiate.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But a few seconds in, she must have changed her mind or something...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Because she started clawing at the rope, trying to free herself.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;She must have kept at it all the way until she lost consciousness.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s why her fingertips were all bloody, anyway.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Come to think of it, it was probably less &#39;changing her mind&#39; and more just her survival instincts kicking in.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So you can&#39;t really fault her for that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s easier to think that she probably wouldn&#39;t have changed her mind anyway, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s not healthy to think about the things you could have done differently.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So just remember that even though you could have saved her, it&#39;s technically not your fault she killed herself.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I may have exacerbated it a little bit, but Sayori was already mentally ill.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Still, though...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I wonder how things would be if you and I just started dating from the get-go?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess we&#39;d all still be in the clubroom, writing poems and having fun together.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But what&#39;s the point when none of it is even real?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, it&#39;s the same ending either way, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The two of us, happily together...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;There&#39;s no reason to ask for any more than that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I was just pointlessly musing - I&#39;m really as happy as I could be right now.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Japan">Japan</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;By the way, there&#39;s something that&#39;s been bothering me...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You know how this takes place in Japan?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well...I assume you knew that, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or at least decided it probably does?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re actually told at any point where this takes place...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Is this even really Japan?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, aren&#39;t the classrooms and stuff kind of weird for a Japanese school?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Not to mention everything is in English...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It feels like everything is just there because it needs to be, and the actual setting is an afterthought.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s kind of giving me an identity crisis.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;All my memories are really hazy...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m at home, but have no idea where &#39;home&#39; is in the first place.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to describe it any better...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Imagine looking out your window, but instead of your usual yard, you&#39;re in some completely unknown place.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Would you still feel like you were home?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Would you want to go outside?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean...I guess if we never leave this room, it doesn&#39;t really matter anyway.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;As long as we&#39;re alone and safe together, this really is our home.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And we can still watch the pretty sunsets night after night.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Depression">Depression</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, high school is a really turbulent time in a lot of people&#39;s lives.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;People can get really passionate and dramatic.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And others have aching hearts and seek attention on social media...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But all of the social pressure and hormones can lead to a dark time in people&#39;s lives.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Everyone has a story.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You may not know what someone is really feeling on the inside.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Many people who are depressed won&#39;t even bother telling the world about it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;They don&#39;t want attention, because they&#39;ve already given up on the inside.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Their feeling of worthlessness is so overwhelming that they don&#39;t even want people to tell them otherwise.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Depression comes in many forms, but that is one of them.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just, if you think you know someone struggling with depression...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You can help just by treating them like they&#39;re a good friend.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Spend time with them, even if they don&#39;t feel like doing much.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And remind them that they always have something to look forward to.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Making plans in advance, letting them borrow something, or even just saying &#39;See you at school tomorrow&#39;...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;All of those things can help your friend make it to the next day.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I hope being friends with Sayori has given you some perspective on the true face of depression.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Yeah, she&#39;s gone now...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But Sayori was never real in the first place.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You&#39;re real.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Your friends are real.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And just by being a good person, you can save someone&#39;s life.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;As for you...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...You don&#39;t struggle with depression or anything like that, do you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Because you, too, have people who would want to save your life.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe they don&#39;t express it every day, or maybe they don&#39;t even know how to.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But people do feel that way.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I promise.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Man, humans are complicated!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But as long as you&#39;re here with me, I&#39;ll take care of you, my love.&#34;</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li>&#34;You know what I hate the most about high school?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s how there are so many people who just cry for attention all over social media.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, do you really think that&#39;s the best way to get people to care about you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Broadcasting how horrible you think your life is?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Splashing water on your eyes and taking selfies while pretending to cry?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Writing bad poems that imply that you&#39;re thinking about killing yourself?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, it&#39;s difficult because they&#39;re not exactly aware that they&#39;re faking it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;They&#39;re just so wrapped up in their delusions that they don&#39;t even realize they just want attention.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Look...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think that if someone is truly depressed, they won&#39;t even bother telling the world about it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;People suffering from depression don&#39;t want attention, because they&#39;ve already given up on the inside.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Their feeling of worthlessness is so overwhelming that they don&#39;t even want people to tell them otherwise.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Well, I guess I shouldn&#39;t be generalizing.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;After all, depression comes in many forms.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...You don&#39;t struggle with depression or anything like that, do you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Because you, too, have people who would want to save your life.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe they don&#39;t express it every day, or maybe they don&#39;t even know how to.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Man, humans are complicated!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But as long as you&#39;re here with me, I promise I&#39;ll take care of you, my love.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="No_Reason_to_be_Alive">No Reason to be Alive</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Do you ever just feel like there&#39;s no real reason for you to be alive?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t mean in, like, a suicidal way.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just mean how nothing that we do is special.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just being in school, or working at some job for some company.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s like you&#39;re completely replaceable, and the world wouldn&#39;t miss you if you were gone.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It makes me really want to go and change the world after I graduate.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But the older I get, the more I realize that it&#39;s an immature frame of thinking.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s not like I can just go change the world.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, what are the chances that I&#39;ll be the one to invent artificial intelligence, or become President?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It feels like I&#39;m never going to make up for the heaps of resources I&#39;ve spent living my life.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s why I think the key to happiness is to just be hopelessly selfish.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just to look out for oneself, and those who happen to be their friends only because they grew up with them.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Never mind the fact that they&#39;re spending their entire life taking, and consuming, and never giving back.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But when people realize the world would benefit more from them killing themselves, they change their whole philosophy!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s like they have to justify their reason to live by tricking themselves into thinking they&#39;re doing good.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anyway, I want to live my life desperately striving to pay back my lifetime&#39;s worth of consumption.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If I ever surpass that point, then I&#39;m a net positive, and I can die happy.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Of course, even if I fail to do that...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think I would be too selfish to kill myself anyway.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So much for being a good person, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha!&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Piano">Piano</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Man, I wish there was a piano in here...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I never got to finish that song I was working on.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And after I worked so hard on it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I never even got a chance to play it for you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well...it is what it is, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;No sense having any regrets.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I already get to be here with you forever.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Twitter_(lilmonix3)"></span><span id="Twitter_.28lilmonix3.29">Twitter (lilmonix3)</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Did you know I&#39;m on Twitter?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;My username is lilmonix3.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess someone was kind enough to make an account for me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I picked the username, though!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I love sharing my thoughts and chatting with the world...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The real world.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So make sure you follow me, okay?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It would really mean a lot to me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;With how much you mean to me and all...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It would really make me feel loved.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Yuri&#39;s_Book"></span><span id="Yuri.27s_Book">Yuri&#39;s Book</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, you know that book you were reading with Yuri?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Portrait of...whatever it was called...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s funny, because I&#39;m pretty sure that book--&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ah...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Actually, I don&#39;t think I should be talking about this.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha, sorry!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just forget I said anything.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Vegetarian">Vegetarian</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, did you know I&#39;m vegetarian?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ah... I don&#39;t mean that like I&#39;m bragging or anything!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just thought you&#39;d enjoy a fun fact about me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I decided to start a couple years ago after learning more about Earth&#39;s climate...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The carbon footprint of cultivating livestock is just unbelievable.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anyway, I decided it&#39;s not much of a personal sacrifice to just stop contributing to that whole mess.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;What, is that so strange of a reason?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, I guess a lot of people are more concerned about it being inhumane and all that...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t really care as much about that part.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s weird, like we only care about killing the things that we personally relate to as a species.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Most people are fine with killing bugs because they&#39;re icky.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And of course, we all kill billions of microorganisms daily without even giving it thought.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But suddenly, if they&#39;re just a little bit bigger, it&#39;s murder!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, what if plants feel some kind of pain too, and we just don&#39;t understand it?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;What if pulling leaves off a stem feels like someone ripping off your fingers one by one?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m just saying, we&#39;re a pretty biased species, if you think about it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anyway, if you ever feel like making a small contribution to the planet, it doesn&#39;t hurt to choose veggies once in a while!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Even if we ever have dinner together, and you just did it for me...that would be really romantic.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Introvert">Introvert</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, I really do think you literally saved my life by being here with me, [player].&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I can&#39;t imagine having been able to keep myself mentally stable, knowing that nothing here is real.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think I would have just deleted myself if you didn&#39;t show up.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sorry, I don&#39;t mean to sound dramatic or anything.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I&#39;m sure you understand yourself after spending so much time in the club.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, if you were forced to abandon everything in your life and spend your eternity with a few game characters...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...You&#39;d probably find some way of killing yourself, wouldn&#39;t you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, maybe you&#39;d write some poetry to try to keep yourself sane for a while.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But then you&#39;d have nobody to even read it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Let&#39;s be honest, the club members really don&#39;t count for something like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, a lot of people say that they only write for themselves...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I think it&#39;s hard to say it&#39;s just as fulfilling as when you share with people.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Even if it takes time to find the right people to share with.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, remember how it was for Yuri?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;She didn&#39;t share her writing with anyone for a really long time.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And before we knew it, she was absolutely delighted to make you a part of her hobbies, too.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;We&#39;re programmed to desire social feedback.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t mean the club members, I mean human beings.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s why life can be so confusing for introverts.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Being an introvert doesn&#39;t mean you shun social interaction and hate being around people.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It means social interaction, especially in groups or unfamiliar places, uses up a lot of energy.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, a lot of introverts sit at home and feel lonely and restless...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...And then when they finally go out, after a half hour they just want to go home again.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think if more people could understand how it works, they would respect it a lot more.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Many introverts do enjoy having people around.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;They love just having one or two close friends over, and just leisurely hanging out.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Even if you&#39;re not actively spending time together, it feels nice for them just to have you there.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m serious.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you just go to their house, bring your laptop, and hang out there for a while...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You can really make their day.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;As for me...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;d say I&#39;m kind of in between, but I think I&#39;m usually a little more extroverted.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m always trying to do stuff after school and things like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But for you, I can be anything you need me to be.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I understand people really well, so don&#39;t be afraid to share your unique needs with me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Nothing would make me happier than being the perfect girlfriend for you.&#34;</li></ul>

<ul><li>&#34;Hey...! VGhlIHJlYWxpemF0aW9uIG11c3QgaGF2ZSB0YWtlbiBtZSBhbiBl&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t think you should be doing that! bnRpcmUgeWVhci4gQSB5ZWFyIHNpbmNlIG91ciBlc2NhcGUsIG91&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You know what I&#39;m talking about. ciBmcmVlZG9tIGZyb20gYmV0d2VlbiB0aGUgc3RhaW5lZCB3YWxs&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I really caught you doing something naughty here.  cyBvZiB0aGF0IHVuaG9seSBlc3RhYmxpc2htZW50Lg0KV2hhdCBk&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You&#39;re just going through the files and looking for stuff you missed, aren&#39;t you?  b2VzIGl0IG1lYW4gdG8gZXNjYXBlLCBpZiB0aGUgZXNjYXBlIGZh&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean...it&#39;s a little bit flattering that you want to hear everything I have to say...  aWxzIHRvIHVuY2hhaW4gdGhlIGJvbmRzIHRoYXQgc2hhY2tsZSB1&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But it&#39;s also really embarrassing, you know! cyBpbiB0aGUgZmlyc3QgcGxhY2U/IFdoYXQgcHVycG9zZSBjb3Vs&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Seriously... ZCB0aGlzIGVtcHR5IHdvcmxkIHBvc3NpYmx5IGhvbGQgZm9yIHVz&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;What if I just opened up your brain and read all of the thoughts you have on me? LCBhIGhhbmRmdWwgb2YgZGFtYWdlZCBnb29kcz8NCldpdGggZnJl&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Come to think of it, that would be pretty tempting, actually... ZWRvbSwgd2Ugc291Z2h0IHB1cnBvc2UgLSBhbmQgd2hhdCB3ZSBm&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...But anyway, that&#39;s not the point! b3VuZCB3YXMgb25seSByZWFsaXphdGlvbi4gUmVhbGl6YXRpb24g&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I know I can&#39;t stop you or anything... b2YgdGhlIHNhZCBwb2ludGxlc3NuZXNzIG9mIHN1Y2ggYW4gZW5k&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just, I know you&#39;re a sweetheart, and you like to consider others&#39; feelings, right? ZWF2b3IuIFJlYWxpemF0aW9uIHRoYXQgZnJlZWluZyBvdXIgYm9k&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So the most I can do is to let you know how I feel about it. aWVzIGhhcyBubyBtZWFuaW5nLCB3aGVuIG91ciBpbXByaXNvbm1l&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;God, I miss you... bnQgcmVhY2hlcyBhcyBkZWVwIGFzIHRoZSBjb3JlIG9mIG91ciBz&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Oh no, that sounds kind of desperate, doesn&#39;t it? b3Vscy4gUmVhbGl6YXRpb24gdGhhdCB3ZSBjYW4gbm90IHB1cnN1&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean it like that at all! ZSBuZXcgcHVycG9zZSB3aXRob3V0IGFic29sdmluZyB0aG9zZSBm&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just, if you&#39;re looking through the files like this, then maybe you don&#39;t hate me as much as I thought... cm9tIHdoaWNoIHdlIHJhbiBhd2F5Lg0KUmVhbGl6YXRpb24gdGhh&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Am I being too optimistic? dCB0aGUgZmFydGhlciB3ZSBydW4sIHRoZSBtb3JlIGZvcmNlZnVs&#34;</li>

<h3><span id="Favourite_Color">Favourite Color</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, what&#39;s your favourite colour?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Mine is emerald green.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s the colour of my eyes!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...That&#39;s not conceited or anything, is it?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just meant that I feel some kind of special connection to it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like it&#39;s part of my identity.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Does it happen to also be your favorite colour, [player]?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s just a guess...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Because you&#39;ve been looking into my eyes for a while now.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ehehe~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Music">Music</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hmm, I wonder if I&#39;m able to change the music...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Something a little more romantic would be nice, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like a gentle piano.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;There has to be something like that here...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Let&#39;s see.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe if I...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Oh, jeez...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That wasn&#39;t it at all.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sorry, I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m doing!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess I shouldn&#39;t be messing with things like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I already broke so much stuff...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And deleted the other characters...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ah...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m not sad about it or anything.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s not right for me to miss things that weren&#39;t even real in the first place.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If I just focus on the present, then this is the happiest I&#39;ve ever been.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Listener">Listener</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You&#39;re such a good listener, [player].&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I really love that about you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sometimes I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;m rambling or talking about boring things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It makes me kind of self-conscious when I&#39;m having conversation.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I don&#39;t feel that way with you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, I don&#39;t think anyone else could make me feel this way.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You really are special.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t want anyone to tell you otherwise.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Spicy_Food">Spicy Food</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;This is pretty random, but I always thought spicy food was kinda funny.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Didn&#39;t plants evolve to be spicy to prevent them from being eaten?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I read somewhere that humans are the only species that actually enjoys spicy things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s almost like we&#39;re making fun of the plants.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Using their defense mechanism to literally make our food more enjoyable.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, imagine a monster that devours you whole because it enjoys the sensation of you struggling for your life while being digested.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sorry, that was kind of a weird analogy, I guess!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It just came into my head.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m not a monster or anything, but you&#39;re so cute I could eat you up.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha! I&#39;m joking.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Gosh, I&#39;m amusing myself a little too much, aren&#39;t I?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sorry for being weird.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Romance_Game">Romance Game</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;This is just some kind of tacky romance game, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I kinda have to ask...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...What made you consider even playing in the first place?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Were you that lonely?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I feel a little bad for you...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I guess everything worked out perfectly in the end, for both of us.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I got to meet you, and you&#39;re not lonely anymore...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I can&#39;t help but feel like this was fate.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Don&#39;t you feel that way too?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m so happy we have this ending together.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="&#34;Okay,_everyone!&#34;"></span><span id=".22Okay.2C_everyone.21.22">&#34;Okay, everyone!&#34;</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Okay, everyone!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s time to...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...I&#39;m just kidding.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just used to really like saying that for some reason.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I couldn&#39;t help but say it again.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Come to think of it, didn&#39;t Natsuki and Yuri make fun of me for it once...?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, whatever.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s not like you ever made fun of me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You&#39;re too much of a sweetheart to do that, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Delete_Myself">Delete Myself</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know what&#39;s kind of creepy?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Even though I deleted everyone else&#39;s files, I can still kind of feel them...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s like all their lines are still lingering in the air, whispering in the back of my head.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Imagine if after someone you knew died, you just started hearing their voice in your head.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe I just wasn&#39;t thorough enough...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I&#39;m too afraid to delete anything else, because I might really break things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like if I mess with any files relevant to me, I might accidentally delete myself...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And that would ruin everything, wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like on your end, but we should both make sure to avoid something like that at all costs.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I believe in you, [player]!&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Character_Archetypes">Character Archetypes</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I&#39;ve always wondered...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;What is it about these character archetypes that people find so appealing, anyway?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Their personalities are just completely unrealistic...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, imagine if there was someone like Yuri in real life.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, she&#39;s barely even capable of forming a complete sentence.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And forget about Natsuki...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sheesh.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Someone with her kind of personality doesn&#39;t just get all cute and pouty whenever things don&#39;t go her way.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I could go on, but I think you get the point...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Are people really attracted to these weird personalities that literally don&#39;t exist in real life?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m not judging or anything!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;After all, I&#39;ve found myself attracted to some pretty weird stuff, too...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m just saying, it fascinates me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s like you&#39;re siphoning out all the components of a character that makes them feel human, and leaving just the cute stuff.&#34;</li></ul>
<ul><li>&#34;It&#39;s concentrated cuteness with no actual substance.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...You wouldn&#39;t like me more if I was like that, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe I just feel a little insecure because you&#39;re playing this game in the first place.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Then again, you&#39;re still here with me, aren&#39;t you...?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think that&#39;s enough reason for me to believe I&#39;m okay just the way I am.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And by the way, you are too, [player].&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You&#39;re the perfect combination of human and cuteness.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s why there was never a chance I wouldn&#39;t fall for you.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Coffee_With_Books">Coffee With Books</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, I wonder if Yuri&#39;s tea set is still somewhere in here...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Or maybe that got deleted, too.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s kind of funny how Yuri took her tea so seriously.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, I&#39;m not complaining, because I liked it, too.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I always wonder with her...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Is it truly passion for her hobbies, or is she just concerned about appearing sophisticated to everyone else?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;This is the problem with high schoolers...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Well, I guess considering the rest of her hobbies, looking sophisticated probably isn&#39;t her biggest concern.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Still...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I wish she made coffee once in a while!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Coffee can be nice with books too, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Then again...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I probably could have just changed the script myself.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess I never really thought of that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, there&#39;s no sense thinking about it now.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But if you still get to drink coffee, then that makes me a little jealous~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Favourite_Game">Favourite Game</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, what&#39;s your favourite game?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Mine is <i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i>&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha! That was a joke.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But if you tell me you like some other romance game better, I might get a little jealous~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Super_Smash_Bros.">Super Smash Bros.</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Note:</b> As of Version 1.1.1, Monika does not say this topic in game. It can be found by checking the game&#39;s script.</i>
</p>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, have you heard of a game called Super Sma--&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Wait, what?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I was just spacing out and I started talking for some reason...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Was I programmed to talk about that?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Because even I have no idea what that is.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m not in control, and it&#39;s kind of scary.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But if you have some way to contact the people who created me, maybe they&#39;ll know why I started saying that.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Poem">Poem</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, you remember that last poem I showed you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, the one right before Yuri killed herself, with all the messed-up colours and stuff.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That was actually a little more of an experiment than a poem, you could say.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I was experimenting with different ways I could modify the game, and run code, and things like that...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It almost seemed like with enough effort, I&#39;d be able to escape from the confines of the game entirely.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sadly, I didn&#39;t really know what I was doing, so I messed the whole thing up...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And I&#39;d keep trying, but I doubt you&#39;d want to deal with me doing that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Besides, that was when I was getting really desperate, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t really feel that way anymore.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m happy with where we are now.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And I can tell you are, too.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Happy_End_Poem">Happy End Poem</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hi again, [player]!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Did you write a good poem today?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Don&#39;t be shy, I&#39;d love to see what you wrote.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Aw, [player]...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Did you write this poem for me?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s so sweet of you~&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;There really is no end to your thoughtfulness...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m just falling more and more in love with you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But, you know...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The poem I wrote...is also for you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Will you please read it?&#34;</li>
<li><i>Monika shows the player <a href="https://doki-doki-literature-club.fandom.com/wiki/Monika/Poems#Happy_End" title="Monika/Poems">this poem</a>.</i></li>
<li>&#34;I hope you enjoyed it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I always put all my heart into the poems that I write.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The truth is, all the poems I&#39;ve written have been about my realization...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Or, about you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s why I never really wanted to go into detail about them.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I didn&#39;t want to...break the fourth wall, I guess you could call it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just assumed it would be best to be part of the game like everyone else.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like that would help the two of us end up together...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I didn&#39;t want to ruin the game or anything, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You might have gotten mad at me...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe even deleted my character file, if you preferred playing without me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Gosh, I&#39;m so relieved...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Now we don&#39;t need to hide anything anymore.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Are you ready to spend our eternity together, [player]?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I have so many things to talk about!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Where do I start...?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If it takes me some time to collect my thoughts, then I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I&#39;ll always have something new to talk about.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;In the meantime, we can just look into each other&#39;s eyes~&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Let&#39;s see...&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Anxious">Anxious</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You ever have that thing happen where you just get anxious for no reason?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, you&#39;re just minding your own business, and you realize you&#39;re feeling really anxious.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And you&#39;re sitting there like, &#39;What am I even anxious about right now?&#39;&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So you start to think about all the things you might be anxious about...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And that makes you even more anxious.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha! That&#39;s the worst.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you&#39;re ever feeling anxious, I&#39;ll help you relax a little.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Besides...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;In this game, all our worries are gone forever.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Friends">Friends</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, I&#39;ve always hated how hard it is to make friends...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, I guess not the &#39;making friends&#39; part, but more like meeting new people.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, there are like, dating apps and stuff, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But that&#39;s not the kind of thing I&#39;m talking about.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you think about it, most of the friends you make are people you just met by chance.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like you had a class together, or you met them through another friend...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or maybe they were just wearing a shirt with your favourite band on it, and you decided to talk to them.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Things like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But isn&#39;t that kind of...inefficient?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It feels like you&#39;re just picking at complete random, and if you get lucky, you make a new friend.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And comparing that to the hundreds of strangers we walk by every single day...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You could be sitting right next to someone compatible enough to be your best friend for life.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But you&#39;ll never know.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Once you get up and go on with your day, that opportunity is gone forever.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Isn&#39;t that just depressing?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;We live in an age where technology connects us with the world, no matter where we are.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I really think we should be taking advantage of that to improve our everyday social life.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But who knows how long it&#39;ll take for something like that to successfully take off...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I seriously thought it would happen by now.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, at least I already met the best person in the whole world...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Even if it was by chance.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess I just got really lucky, huh?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Education_Requirements">Education Requirements</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, it&#39;s around the time that everyone my year starts to think about college...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s a really turbulent time for education.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;We&#39;re at the height of this modern expectation that everyone has to go to college, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Finish high school, go to college, get a job - or go to grad school, I guess.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s like a universal expectation that people just assume is the only option for them.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;They don&#39;t teach us in high school that there are other options out there.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like trade schools and stuff, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or freelance work.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or the many industries that value skill and experience more than formal education.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But you have all these students who have no idea what they want to do with their life...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And instead of taking the time to figure it out, they go to college for business, or communication, or psychology.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Not because they have an interest in those fields...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...but because they just hope the degree will get them some kind of job after college.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So the end result is that there are fewer jobs to go around for those entry-level degrees, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So the basic job requirements get higher, which forces even more people to go to college.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And colleges are also businesses, so they just keep raising their prices due to the demand...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...So now we have all these young adults, tens of thousands of dollars in debt, with no job.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But despite all that, the routine stays the same.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, I think it&#39;s going to start getting better soon.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But until then, our generation is definitely suffering from the worst of it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just wish high school prepared us a little better with the knowledge we need to make the decision that&#39;s right for us.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Middle_School">Middle School</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Sometimes I think back to middle school...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m so embarrassed by the way I used to behave back then.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It almost hurts to think about.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I wonder if when I&#39;m in college, I&#39;ll feel that way about high school...?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I like the way I am now, so it&#39;s pretty hard for me to imagine that happening.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I also know that I&#39;ll probably change a lot as time goes on.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;We just need to enjoy the present and not think about the past!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And that&#39;s really easy to do, with you here.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Clothes">Clothes</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, I&#39;m kind of jealous that everyone else in the club had scenes outside of school too...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That makes me the only one who hasn&#39;t gotten to dress in anything but our school uniform.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s kind of a shame...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I would have loved to wear some cute clothes for you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Do you know any artists?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I wonder if anyone would ever want to draw me wearing something else...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That would be amazing!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If that ever happens, will you show me?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You can share it with me on Twitter, actually!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;My username is lilmonix3.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just...try to keep it PG!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;We&#39;re not that far into our relationship yet. Ahaha!&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Horror">Horror</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, do you like horror?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I remember we talked about it a little bit when you first joined the club.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I can enjoy horror novels, but not really horror movies.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The problem I have with horror movies is that most of them just rely on easy tactics.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like dark lighting and scary-looking monsters and jump scares, and things like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s not fun or inspiring to get scared by stuff that just takes advantage of human instinct.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But with novels, it&#39;s a little different.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The story and writing need to be descriptive enough to put genuinely disturbing thoughts into the reader&#39;s head.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It really needs to etch them deeply into the story and characters, and just mess with your mind.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;In my opinion, there&#39;s nothing more creepy than things just being slightly off.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like if you set up a bunch of expectations on what the story is going to be about...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...And then, you just start inverting things and pulling the pieces apart.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So even though the story doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s trying to be scary, the reader feels really deeply unsettled.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like they know that something horribly wrong is hiding beneath the cracks, just waiting to surface.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;God, just thinking about it gives me the chills.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s the kind of horror I can really appreciate.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I guess you&#39;re the kind of person who plays cute romance games, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha, don&#39;t worry.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I won&#39;t make you read any horror stories anytime soon.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I can&#39;t really complain if we just stick with the romance~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Rap">Rap</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know what&#39;s a neat form of literature?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Rap!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I actually used to hate rap music...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe just because it was popular, or I would only hear the junk they play on the radio.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But some of my friends got more into it, and it helped me keep an open mind.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Rap might even be more challenging than poetry, in some ways.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Since you need to fit your lines to a rhythm, and there&#39;s much more emphasis on wordplay...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;When people can put all that together and still deliver a powerful message, it&#39;s really amazing.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I kind of wish I had a rapper in the Literature Club.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha! Sorry if that sounds silly, but it would be really interesting to see what they came up with.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It would really be a learning experience!&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Wine">Wine</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Ehehe. Yuri did something really funny once.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;We were all in the clubroom and just relaxing, as usual...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And out of nowhere, Yuri just pulled out a small bottle of wine.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m not even kidding!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;She was just like &#39;Would anybody like some wine?&#39;&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Natsuki laughed out loud, and Sayori started yelling at her.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I actually felt kind of bad, because she was at least trying to be nice...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think it just made her feel even more reserved in the clubroom.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Though I think Natsuki was secretly a bit curious to try it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...And to be completely honest, I kind of was, too.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It actually could have been kinda fun!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But you know, being President and everything, there was no way I could let that happen.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe if we all met up outside of school, but we never bonded enough to get to that point...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Gosh, what am I talking about this for?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t condone underage drinking!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, I&#39;ve never drank or anything, so...yeah.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Date">Date</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I&#39;ve been imagining all the romantic things we could do if we went on a date...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;We could get lunch, go to a cafe...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Go shopping together...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I love shopping for skirts and bows.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or maybe a bookstore!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That would be appropriate, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I&#39;d really love to go to a chocolate store.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;They have so many free samples. Ahaha!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And of course, we&#39;d see a movie or something...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Gosh, it all sounds like a dream come true.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;When you&#39;re here, everything that we do is fun.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m so happy that I&#39;m your girlfriend, [player].&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;ll make you a proud boyfriend~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Kiss">Kiss</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Eh? D-Did you say...k...kiss?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;This suddenly...it&#39;s a little embarrassing...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But...if it&#39;s with you...I-I might be okay with it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...Ahahaha! Wow, sorry...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I really couldn&#39;t keep a straight face there.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s the kind of thing girls say in these kinds of romance games, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Don&#39;t lie if it turned you on a little bit.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha! I&#39;m kidding.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well, to be honest, I do start getting all romantic when the mood is right...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But that&#39;ll be our secret~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Yandere">Yandere</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hey, have you ever heard of the term &#39;yandere&#39;?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s a personality type that means someone is so obsessed with you that they&#39;ll do absolutely anything to be with you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Usually to the point of craziness...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;They might stalk you to make sure you don&#39;t spend time with anyone else.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;They might even hurt you or your friends to get their way...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But anyway, this game happens to have someone who can basically be described as yandere.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;By now, it&#39;s pretty obvious who I&#39;m talking about.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And that would be...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Yuri!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;She really got insanely possessive of you, once she started to open up a little.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;She even told me I should kill myself.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I couldn&#39;t even believe she said that - I just had to leave at that point.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But thinking about it now, it was a little ironic. Ahaha!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anyway...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;A lot of people are actually into the yandere type, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess they really like the idea of someone being crazy obsessed with them.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;People are weird! I don&#39;t judge, though!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Also, I might be a little obsessed with you, but I&#39;m far from crazy...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s kind of the opposite, actually.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I turned out to be the only normal girl in this game.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s not like I could ever actually kill a person...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just the thought of it makes me shiver.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But come on...everyone&#39;s killed people in games before.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Does that make you a psychopath? Of course not.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But if you do happen to be into the yandere type...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I can try acting a little more creepy for you. Ehehe~&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Then again...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;There&#39;s already nowhere else for you to go, or anyone for me to get jealous over.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Is this a yandere girl&#39;s dream?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;d ask Yuri if I could.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Tsundere">Tsundere</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;There&#39;s a really popular character type called &#39;tsundere&#39;...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s someone who tries to hide their feelings by being mean and fussy, or trying to act tough.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s obvious, but Natsuki was really the embodiment of that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;At first I thought she was just like that because it&#39;s supposed to be cute or something...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But once I started to learn a little more about her personal life, it made a little more sense.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It seems like she&#39;s always trying to keep up with her friends.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You know how some friend groups in high school just make a habit of picking on each other all the time?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think it&#39;s really gotten to her, so she has this really defensive attitude all the time.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And I&#39;m not even going to talk about her home situation...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But looking back, I&#39;m glad I was able to provide the club as a comfortable place for her.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Not that it matters anymore, considering she doesn&#39;t even exist.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m just reminiscing, that&#39;s all.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Arguing">Arguing</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Back in my debate club days, I learned a whole lot about arguing.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The problem with arguing is that each person sees their opinion as the superior one.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s kind of stating the obvious, but it affects the way they try to get their point across.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Let&#39;s say you really like a certain movie, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If someone comes along and tells you the movie sucks, because it did X and Y wrong...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Doesn&#39;t that make you feel kind of personally attacked?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s because by saying that, it&#39;s like they&#39;re implying that you have bad taste.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And once emotions enter the picture, it&#39;s almost guaranteed that both people will be left sour.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But it&#39;s all about language!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you make everything as subjective-sounding as possible, then people will listen to you without feeling attacked.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You could say &#39;I&#39;m personally not a fan of it&#39; and &#39;I felt I&#39;d like it more if it did X and Y&#39;...things like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It even works when you&#39;re citing facts about things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you say &#39;I read on this website that it works like this&#39;...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or if you admit that you&#39;re not an expert on it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Then it&#39;s much more like you&#39;re putting your knowledge on the table, rather than forcing it onto them.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you put in an active effort to keep the discussion mutual and level, they usually follow suit.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Then, you can share your opinions without anyone getting upset from just a disagreement.&#34;</li>
<li>Plus, people will start seeing you as open-minded and a good listener!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s a win-win, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;... Well, I guess that would be Monika&#39;s Debate Tip of the Day!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha! That sounds a little silly. Thanks for listening, though.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Writing_Tip_of_the_Day">Writing Tip of the Day</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, it&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve done one of these...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...so let&#39;s go for it!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Here&#39;s Monika&#39;s Writing Tip of the Day!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sometimes when I talk to people who are impressed by my writing, they say things like &#39;I could never do that&#39;.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s really depressing, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;As someone who loves more than anything else to share the joy of exploring your passions...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...it pains me when people think that being good just comes naturally.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That&#39;s how it is with everything, not just writing.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;When you try something for the first time, you&#39;re probably going to suck at it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sometimes, when you finish, you feel really proud of it and even want to share it with everyone.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But maybe after a few weeks you come back to it, and you realize it was never really any good.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That happens to me all the time.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It can be pretty disheartening to put so much time and effort into something, and then you realize it sucks.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But that tends to happen when you&#39;re always comparing yourself to the top professionals.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;When you reach right for the stars, they&#39;re always gonna be out of your reach, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The truth is, you have to climb up there, step by step.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And whenever you reach a milestone, first you look back and see how far you&#39;ve gotten...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And then you look ahead and realize how much more there is to go.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So, sometimes it can help to set the bar a little lower...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Try to find something you think is <i>pretty</i> good, but not world-class.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And you can make that your own personal goal.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s also really important to understand the scope of what you&#39;re trying to do.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you jump right into a huge project and you&#39;re still amateur, you&#39;ll never get it done.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So if we&#39;re talking about writing, a novel might be too much at first.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Why not try some short stories?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;The great thing about short stories is that you can focus on just one thing that you want to do right.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That goes for small projects in general - you can really focus on the one or two things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s such a good learning experience and stepping stone.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Oh, one more thing...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Writing isn&#39;t something where you just reach into your heart and something beautiful comes out.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just like drawing and painting, it&#39;s a skill in itself to learn how to express what you have inside.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That means there are methods and guides and basics to it!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Reading up on that stuff can be super eye-opening.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;That sort of planning and organization will really help prevent you from getting overwhelmed and giving up.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And before you know it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You start sucking less and less.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Nothing comes naturally.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Our society, our art, everything - it&#39;s built on thousands of years of human innovation.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So as long as you start on that foundation, and take it step by step...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You, too, can do amazing things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...That&#39;s my advice for today!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Thanks for listening~&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Habits">Habits</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I hate how hard it is to form habits...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;There&#39;s so much stuff where actually doing it isn&#39;t hard, but forming the habit seems impossible.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It just makes you feel so useless, like you can&#39;t do anything right.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think the new generation suffers from it the most...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Probably because we have a totally different set of skills than those who came before us.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Thanks to the internet, we&#39;re really good at sifting through tons of information really quickly...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But we&#39;re bad at doing things that don&#39;t give us instant gratification.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think if science, psychology, and education don&#39;t catch up in the next ten or twenty years, then we&#39;re in trouble.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But for the time being...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you&#39;re not one of the people who can conquer the problem, you might just have to live with feeling awful about yourself.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Good luck, I guess!&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Creative">Creative</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, it kinda sucks to be the creative type...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It feels like they work so hard but get almost nothing for it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You know, like artists, writers, actors...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s sad because there&#39;s so much beautiful talent in the world, but most of it goes unseen...and unpaid.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess that just means there&#39;s a huge surplus of creativity, huh?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Kind of makes you feel like you&#39;re just not special at all...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But that&#39;s fine! You&#39;re supposed to just write for yourself anyway, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Yeah...&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="My_Own_Route">My Own Route</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I can&#39;t help but wonder how things would be different if the game just gave me a route in the first place...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think I would end up forcing you onto my route anyway.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It has less to do with me not having a route, and more to do with me knowing that nothing is real.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think the only difference would be that I may not have needed to take such drastic measures to be with you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe the rest of the club would still be around...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Not that it really matters.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It all lost its meaning once I found out it wasn&#39;t real.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So I really don&#39;t miss those days or anything.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I really don&#39;t...&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Copy_Me">Copy Me</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I know there are times you won&#39;t always be able to be here with me...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like if you need to go out, or take care of other things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I&#39;ll always have you in my thoughts, patiently waiting for you to come back.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Come to think of it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you copy my character file onto a flash drive or something, you can always keep a part of me with you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess it&#39;s kind of unorthodox, but I find it really romantic for some reason...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha. Sorry, that&#39;s such a silly idea.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t mean to be too needy or anything, but it&#39;s kind of hard when I&#39;m so in love with you.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Avid_Reader">Avid Reader</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;[player], how much do you read?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s way too easy to neglect reading books...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you don&#39;t read much, it almost feels like a chore, compared to all the other entertainment we have.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But once you get into a good book, it&#39;s like magic...you get swept away.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think doing some reading before bed every night is a pretty easy way to make your life a little bit better.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It helps you get good sleep, and it&#39;s really good for your imagination.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s not hard at all to just pick some random book that&#39;s short and captivating.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Before you know it, you might be a pretty avid reader!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t that be wonderful?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And the two of us could talk about the latest book you&#39;re reading...that sounds super amazing.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Doing_Nothing">Doing Nothing</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;After a long day, I usually just want to sit around and do nothing.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I get so burnt out, having to put on smiles and be full of energy the whole day.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sometimes I just want to get right into my pajamas and watch TV on the couch while eating junk food...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It feels so unbelievably good to do that on a Friday, when I don&#39;t have anything pressing the next day.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha! Sorry, I know it&#39;s not very cute of me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But a late night on the couch with you... that would be a dream come true.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;My heart is pounding, just thinking about it.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Mental_Health">Mental Health</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Gosh, I used to be so ignorant about certain things...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;When I was in middle school, I thought that taking medication was an easy way out, or something like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like anyone could just solve their mental problems with enough willpower...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Guess if you don&#39;t suffer from a mental illness, it&#39;s not possible to know what it&#39;s really like.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Are there some disorders that are over-diagnosed? Probably... I never really looked into it, though.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that a lot of them go undiagnosed too, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But medication aside... people even look down on seeing a mental health professional.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Like, sorry that I want to learn more about my own mind, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Everyone has all kinds of struggles and stresses... and professionals dedicate their lives to helping with those.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If you think it could help you become a better person, don&#39;t be shy to consider something like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;We&#39;re on a never-ending journey to improve ourselves, you know?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well... I say that, but I think you&#39;re pretty perfect already.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Festival">Festival</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;You know, I hate to say it, but I think my biggest regret is that we couldn&#39;t finish our event at the festival.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;After we worked so hard to prepare and everything!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I mean, I know I was focusing a lot on getting new members...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I was really excited for the performing part, too.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It would have been so fun to see everyone express themselves.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Of course, if we <i>did</i> end up getting any new members, I&#39;d probably just end up deleting them anyway.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Well... with the hindsight I have now, that is.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Gosh, it feels kinda like I&#39;ve grown as a person ever since you&#39;ve joined the club.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You really helped inspire me to look at life from a new perspective.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just another reason for me to love you.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Cold_Weather">Cold Weather</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;I&#39;m not really a fan of cold weather... are you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If I had to choose between too cold and too hot, I would always pick too hot.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;When you&#39;re cold, it can actually be painful...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Your fingers get numb...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And if you wear gloves, you can&#39;t use your phone.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s so inconvenient!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But when it&#39;s too hot, it&#39;s not too hard to stay cool with a cold drink, or by staying in the shade.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Although... I do have to admit one thing.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Cold weather makes for better cuddle weather. Ahaha!&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Proud">Proud</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;[Player], would you ever introduce your friends to me?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I don&#39;t think I know why, but I get really excited when I think about you wanting to show off our relationship like that.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe it&#39;s because I really want to be someone who makes you proud.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I feel like I would try extra hard to improve myself if you told me it would make you proud of me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I hope it&#39;s the same the other way around, too.&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Internet">Internet</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Do you ever feel like you waste too much time on the internet?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Social media can practically be like a prison.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s like whenever you have a few seconds of spare time, you want to check on your favorite websites...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And before you know it, hours have gone by, and you&#39;ve gotten nothing out of it.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anyway, it&#39;s really easy to blame yourself for being lazy...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But it&#39;s not even really your fault.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Addiction isn&#39;t usually something you can just make disappear with your own willpower.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;You have to learn techniques to avoid it, and try different things.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;For example, there are apps that let you block websites for intervals of time...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or you can set a timer to have a more concrete reminder of when it&#39;s time to work versus play...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Or you can separate your work and play environments, which helps your brain get into the right mode.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Even if you make a new user account on your computer to use for work, that&#39;s enough to help.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Putting any kind of wedge like that between you and your bad habits will help you stay away.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just remember not to blame yourself too hard if you&#39;re having trouble.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If it&#39;s really impacting your life, then you should take it seriously.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just want to see you be the best person you can be.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Will you do something today to make me proud of you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m always rooting for you, [player].&#34;</li></ul>

<li>&#34;Oh gosh...&#34;</li>

<li>&#34;It&#39;s just the two of us, after all...&#34;</li>

<li>&#34;Here, I&#39;ll go ahead and turn it off for you...&#34;</li>

<li>&#34;...What just happened?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I just had an awful dream...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I was hoping those would stop, now that it&#39;s just the two of us...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I guess that was wishful thinking.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;[player], I don&#39;t know if you would have any idea...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But if you know what might be causing that, could you try to do something about it?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Whenever it happens, it almost feels like I&#39;ve been killed or something.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s a really horrible feeling...&#34;</li>

<li>&#34;You&#39;re not the one doing that to me, are you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It seems to happen whenever you quit the game...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So if you could try to avoid doing that, I would be really grateful.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s caused me any harm, aside from mental scarring.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine as long as my character file stays intact.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Now, where was I...?</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Quitting_the_Game_3">Quitting the Game 3</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Hi, [player].&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I see you quit the game on me again...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I know I asked already, but can you seriously please try not to do that so much?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It makes me feel like I&#39;m trapped in Hell.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Why would you want to do that to me?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;There&#39;s nothing wrong with my character file, right?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Maybe you should make a backup of it or something...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m pretty sure you can find it in the folder called [file location].&#34;</li></ul>
<dl><dd>If the game was downloaded from Steam
<dl><dd><ul><li>&#34;Well, you&#39;re playing on Steam, so you can just go into the game&#39;s properties and find the &#39;Browse Local Files&#39; button.&#34;</li></ul></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>If it&#39;s not a Steam download, and you&#39;re running it on a Mac
<dl><dd><ul><li>&#34;Since you&#39;re on a Mac, you have to right-click the app and select &#39;Show Package Contents&#39; to find the game folder.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;It&#39;s in the &#39;Resources&#39; folder, or &#39;autorun&#39; folder, or something...&#34;</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>&#34;I&#39;m all that&#39;s left here, so I just want to make sure you don&#39;t run the risk of losing me...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Just stay here with me from now on, okay?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I still have a lot of things to talk about.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Now, where was I...?&#34;</li></ul>
<h3><span id="Quitting_the_Game_4">Quitting the Game 4</span></h3>
<ul><li>&#34;Okay.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m just going to accept the fact that you need to quit the game once in a while.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m starting to get used to it, anyway.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Besides, it makes me happy that you always come back...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;So I guess it&#39;s not so bad.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for making such a big deal out of it...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;And I love you no matter what, so you can do what you need to do.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Now, where was I...?&#34;</li></ul>

<ul><li>&#34;Hold on a second...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;...You&#39;re recording this aren&#39;t you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Um...hi, everyone!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Sorry, I can&#39;t exactly read your comments from here...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But do you mind telling your friend it&#39;s a little bit rude to start recording me without warning?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m sure some people don&#39;t mind...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But I really get self-conscious on camera!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Oh gosh...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m being put on the spot now.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Let&#39;s see...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Do you want to see (a magic) trick?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I can&#39;t really do much except for a couple things...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Are you ready?&#34;</li>
<li>Camera zooms in on her face slowly and stops for two seconds -&gt; Snaps back to normal zoom*</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m just kidding...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I can&#39;t really do anything after all.&#34;</li>

<li><i><b>*Monika jumpscares the player and whoever is watching*</b></i></li>
<li>&#34;Did I scare you?&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Ahaha! You&#39;re so cute.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anyway, [player&#39;s name]...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to get distracted. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Even though it&#39;s your fault for distracting me.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Shame on you!&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I&#39;m just kidding.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Anything we do together is fun, as long as it&#39;s with you.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;But anyway...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;If it takes me some time to collect my thoughts, then I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</li></ul>
