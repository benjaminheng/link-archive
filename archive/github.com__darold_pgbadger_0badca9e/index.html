<p>Arguments:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="logfile can be a single log file, a list of files, or a shell command
returning a list of files. If you want to pass log content from stdin
use - as filename. Note that input from stdin will not work with csvlog.

<p>Options:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="-a | --average minutes : number of minutes to build the average graphs of
                         queries and connections. Default 5 minutes.
-A | --histo-average min: number of minutes to build the histogram graphs
                         of queries. Default 60 minutes.
-b | --begin datetime  : start date/time for the data to be parsed in log
                         (either a timestamp or a time)
-c | --dbclient host   : only report on entries for the given client host.
-C | --nocomment       : remove comments like /* ... */ from queries.
-d | --dbname database : only report on entries for the given database.
-D | --dns-resolv      : client ip addresses are replaced by their DNS name.
                         Be warned that this can really slow down pgBadger.
-e | --end datetime    : end date/time for the data to be parsed in log
                         (either a timestamp or a time)
-E | --explode         : explode the main report by generating one report
                         per database. Global information not related to a
                         database are added to the postgres database report.
-f | --format logtype  : possible values: syslog, syslog2, stderr, jsonlog,
                         cvs, pgbouncer, logplex, rds and redshift. Use this

--normalized-only      : only dump all normalized query to out.txt
--log-timezone +/-XX   : Set the number of hours from GMT of the timezone
                         that must be used to adjust date/time read from
                         log file before beeing parsed. Using this option
                         make more difficult log search with a date/time.
--prettify-json        : use it if you want json output to be prettified.
--month-report YYYY-MM : create a cumulative HTML report over the specified
                         month. Requires incremental output directories and

--no-week              : inform pgbadger to not build weekly reports in
                         incremental mode. Useful if it takes too much time.
--explain-url URL      : use it to override the url of the graphical explain
                         tool. Default: http://explain.depesz.com/?is_public=0&amp;is_anon=0&amp;plan=
--tempdir DIR          : set directory where temporary files will be written
                         Default: File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir() || &#39;/tmp&#39;

<p>Log file to parse can also be specified using an URI, supported protocol are
http[s] and [s]ftp. The curl command will be used to download the file and the
file will be parsed during download. The ssh protocol is also supported and will
use the ssh command like with the remote host use. See examples bellow.</p>

pgbadger ssh://username@172.12.110.14:2222//var/log/postgresql/postgresql-10.1-main.log*
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can use together a local PostgreSQL log and a remote pgbouncer log file to parse:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-10.1-main.log ssh://username@172.12.110.14/pgbouncer.log

<p>Reporting errors every week by cron job:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="30 23 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q -w /var/log/postgresql.log -o /var/reports/pg_errors.html
"><pre><code>30 23 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q -w /var/log/postgresql.log -o /var/reports/pg_errors.html
</code></pre></div>
<p>Generate report every week using incremental behavior:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="0 4 * * 1 /usr/bin/pgbadger -q `find /var/log/ -mtime -7 -name &#34;postgresql.log*&#34;` -o /var/reports/pg_errors-`date +\%F`.html -l /var/reports/pgbadger_incremental_file.dat

</code></pre></div>
<p>This supposes that your log file and HTML report are also rotated every week.</p>
<p>Or better, use the auto-generated incremental reports:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="0 4 * * * /usr/bin/pgbadger -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 -O /var/www/pg_reports/
"><pre><code>0 4 * * * /usr/bin/pgbadger -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 -O /var/www/pg_reports/
</code></pre></div>
<p>will generate a report per day and per week.</p>
<p>In incremental mode, you can also specify the number of week to keep in the
reports:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/usr/bin/pgbadger --retention 2 -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 -O /var/www/pg_reports/
"><pre><code>/usr/bin/pgbadger --retention 2 -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 -O /var/www/pg_reports/
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you have a pg_dump at 23:00 and 13:00 each day during half an hour, you can
use pgBadger as follow to exclude these period from the report:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger --exclude-time &#34;2013-09-.* (23|13):.*&#34; postgresql.log
"><pre><code>pgbadger --exclude-time &#34;2013-09-.* (23|13):.*&#34; postgresql.log
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will help avoid having COPY statements, as generated by pg_dump, on top of
the list of slowest queries. You can also use --exclude-appname &#34;pg_dump&#34; to
solve this problem in a simpler way.</p>
<p>You can also parse journalctl output just as if it was a log file:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger --journalctl &#39;journalctl -u postgresql-9.5&#39;
"><pre><code>pgbadger --journalctl &#39;journalctl -u postgresql-9.5&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>or worst, call it from a remote host:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger -r 192.168.1.159 --journalctl &#39;journalctl -u postgresql-9.5&#39;
"><pre><code>pgbadger -r 192.168.1.159 --journalctl &#39;journalctl -u postgresql-9.5&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>you don&#39;t need to specify any log file at command line, but if you have other
PostgreSQL log file to parse, you can add them as usual.</p>
<p>To rebuild all incremental html reports after, proceed as follow:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rm /path/to/reports/*.js
rm /path/to/reports/*.css
pgbadger -X -I -O /path/to/reports/ --rebuild
"><pre><code>rm /path/to/reports/*.js
rm /path/to/reports/*.css
pgbadger -X -I -O /path/to/reports/ --rebuild
</code></pre></div>
<p>it will also update all resource files (JS and CSS). Use -E or --explode
if the reports were built using this option.</p>
<p>pgBadger also support Heroku PostgreSQL logs using logplex format:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="heroku logs -p postgres | pgbadger -f logplex -o heroku.html -
"><pre><code>heroku logs -p postgres | pgbadger -f logplex -o heroku.html -
</code></pre></div>
<p>this will stream Heroku PostgreSQL log to pgbadger through stdin.</p>
<p>pgBadger can auto detect RDS and cloudwatch PostgreSQL logs using
rds format:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger -f rds -o rds_out.html rds.log
"><pre><code>pgbadger -f rds -o rds_out.html rds.log
</code></pre></div>
<p>CloudSQL Postgresql logs it&#39;s fairly normal PostgreSQL log but encapsulated in
JSON format. It is auto detected too by pgBagder but in case you need to force
the log format, use `jsonlog`</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger -f jsonlog -o cloudsql_out.html cloudsql.log
"><pre><code>pgbadger -f jsonlog -o cloudsql_out.html cloudsql.log
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the same than with the jsonlog extension, the json format is different
but pgBadger can parse both format.</p>
<p>To create a cumulative report over a month use command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger --month-report 2919-05 /path/to/incremantal/reports/
"><pre><code>pgbadger --month-report 2919-05 /path/to/incremantal/reports/
</code></pre></div>
<p>this will add a link to the month name into the calendar view in
incremental reports to look at report for month 2019 May.
Use -E or --explode if the reports were built using this option.</p>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer built for speed with fully reports
from your PostgreSQL log file. It&#39;s a single and small Perl script that
outperforms any other PostgreSQL log analyzer.</p>
<p>It is written in pure Perl and uses a JavaScript library (flotr2) to draw
graphs so that you don&#39;t need to install any additional Perl modules or
other packages. Furthermore, this library gives us more features such
as zooming. pgBadger also uses the Bootstrap JavaScript library and
the FontAwesome webfont for better design. Everything is embedded.</p>
<p>pgBadger is able to autodetect your log file format (syslog, stderr, csvlog
or jsonlog) if the file is long enough. It is designed to parse huge log
files as well as compressed files. Supported compressed format are gzip,
bzip2, lz4, xz, zip and zstd. For the xz format you must have an xz version
upper than 5.05 that supports the --robot option. In order pgbadger determine
uncompressed file size with lz4, file must be compressed with --content-size
option. For the complete list of features see below.</p>
<p>All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images.</p>
<p>You can also limit pgBadger to only report errors or remove any part of the
report using command line options.</p>
<p>pgBadger supports any custom format set into the log_line_prefix directive of
your postgresql.conf file as long as it at least specify the %t and %p patterns.</p>
<p>pgBadger allows parallel processing of a single log file or multiple
files through the use of the -j option specifying the number of CPUs.</p>
<p>If you want to save system performance you can also use log_duration instead of
log_min_duration_statement to have reports on duration and number of queries only.</p>
<h3>FEATURE</h3>
<p>pgBadger reports everything about your SQL queries:</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also have incremental reports with one report per day and a cumulative
report per week. Two multiprocess modes are available to speed up log parsing,
one using one core per log file, and the second using multiple cores to parse
a single file. These modes can be combined.</p>
<p>Histogram granularity can be adjusted using the -A command line option. By default
they will report the mean of each top queries/errors occurring per hour, but you can
specify the granularity down to the minute.</p>
<p>pgBadger can also be used in a central place to parse remote log files using a
passwordless SSH connection. This mode can be used with compressed files and in
the multiprocess per file mode (-J) but can not be used with the CSV log format.</p>
<h3>REQUIREMENT</h3>
<p>pgBadger comes as a single Perl script - you do not need anything other than a modern
Perl distribution. Charts are rendered using a JavaScript library so you don&#39;t need
anything other than a web browser. Your browser will do all the work.</p>
<p>If you planned to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files you might need some Perl Modules:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    Text::CSV_XS - to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files.
"><pre><code>    Text::CSV_XS - to parse PostgreSQL CSV log files.
</code></pre></div>
<p>This module is optional, if you don&#39;t have PostgreSQL log in the CSV format you don&#39;t
need to install it.</p>
<p>If you want to export statistics as JSON file you need an additional Perl module:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    JSON::XS - JSON serialising/deserialising, done correctly and fast
"><pre><code>    JSON::XS - JSON serialising/deserialising, done correctly and fast
</code></pre></div>
<p>This module is optional, if you don&#39;t select the json output format you don&#39;t
need to install it. You can install it on a Debian like system using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    sudo apt-get install libjson-xs-perl
"><pre><code>    sudo apt-get install libjson-xs-perl
</code></pre></div>
<p>and in RPM like system using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    sudo yum install perl-JSON-XS
"><pre><code>    sudo yum install perl-JSON-XS
</code></pre></div>
<p>Compressed log file format is autodetected from the file extension. If pgBadger find
a gz extension it will use the zcat utility, with a bz2 extension it will use bzcat,
with lz4 it will use lz4cat, with zst it will use zstdcat and if the file extension
is zip or xz then the unzip or xz utilities will be used.</p>
<p>If those utilities are not found in the PATH environment variable then use the --zcat
command line option to change this path. For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    --zcat=&#34;/usr/local/bin/gunzip -c&#34; or --zcat=&#34;/usr/local/bin/bzip2 -dc&#34;
    --zcat=&#34;C:\tools\unzip -p&#34;
"><pre><code>    --zcat=&#34;/usr/local/bin/gunzip -c&#34; or --zcat=&#34;/usr/local/bin/bzip2 -dc&#34;
    --zcat=&#34;C:\tools\unzip -p&#34;
</code></pre></div>
<p>By default pgBadger will use the zcat, bzcat, lz4cat, zstdcat and unzip utilities
following the file extension. If you use the default autodetection compress format
you can mixed gz, bz2, lz4, xz, zip or zstd files. Specifying a custom value to
--zcat option will remove this feature of mixed compressed format.</p>
<p>Note that multiprocessing can not be used with compressed files or CSV files as
well as under Windows platform.</p>
<h3>INSTALLATION</h3>
<p>Download the tarball from GitHub and unpack the archive as follow:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    tar xzf pgbadger-11.x.tar.gz
    cd pgbadger-11.x/
    perl Makefile.PL
    make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
"><pre><code>    tar xzf pgbadger-11.x.tar.gz
    cd pgbadger-11.x/
    perl Makefile.PL
    make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will copy the Perl script pgbadger to /usr/local/bin/pgbadger by default and the
man page into /usr/local/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1. Those are the default installation
directories for &#39;site&#39; install.</p>
<p>If you want to install all under /usr/ location, use INSTALLDIRS=&#39;perl&#39; as an argument
of Makefile.PL. The script will be installed into /usr/bin/pgbadger and the manpage
into /usr/share/man/man1/pgbadger.1.</p>
<p>For example, to install everything just like Debian does, proceed as follows:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
"><pre><code>    perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
</code></pre></div>
<p>By default INSTALLDIRS is set to site.</p>
<h3>POSTGRESQL CONFIGURATION</h3>
<p>You must enable and set some configuration directives in your postgresql.conf
before starting.</p>
<p>You must first enable SQL query logging to have something to parse:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    log_min_duration_statement = 0
"><pre><code>    log_min_duration_statement = 0
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here every statement will be logged, on a busy server you may want to increase
this value to only log queries with a longer duration. Note that if you have
log_statement set to &#39;all&#39; nothing will be logged through the log_min_duration_statement
directive. See the next chapter for more information.</p>
<p>pgBadger supports any custom format set into the log_line_prefix directive of
your postgresql.conf file as long as it at least specify a time escape sequence
(%t, %m or %n) and the process related escape sequence (%p or %c).</p>
<p>For example, with &#39;stderr&#39; log format, log_line_prefix must be at least:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: &#39;
"><pre><code>    log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: &#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Log line prefix could add user, database name, application name and client ip
address as follows:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h &#39;
"><pre><code>    log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h &#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>or for syslog log file format:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    log_line_prefix = &#39;user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h &#39;
"><pre><code>    log_line_prefix = &#39;user=%u,db=%d,app=%a,client=%h &#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Log line prefix for stderr output could also be:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: db=%d,user=%u,app=%a,client=%h &#39;
"><pre><code>    log_line_prefix = &#39;%t [%p]: db=%d,user=%u,app=%a,client=%h &#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>or for syslog output:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    log_line_prefix = &#39;db=%d,user=%u,app=%a,client=%h &#39;
"><pre><code>    log_line_prefix = &#39;db=%d,user=%u,app=%a,client=%h &#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>You need to enable other parameters in postgresql.conf to get more information from your log files:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    log_checkpoints = on
    log_connections = on
    log_disconnections = on
    log_lock_waits = on
    log_temp_files = 0
    log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0
    log_error_verbosity = default
"><pre><code>    log_checkpoints = on
    log_connections = on
    log_disconnections = on
    log_lock_waits = on
    log_temp_files = 0
    log_autovacuum_min_duration = 0
    log_error_verbosity = default
</code></pre></div>
<p>Do not enable log_statement as its log format will not be parsed by pgBadger.</p>
<p>Of course your log messages should be in English with or without locale support:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    lc_messages=&#39;en_US.UTF-8&#39;
    lc_messages=&#39;C&#39;
"><pre><code>    lc_messages=&#39;en_US.UTF-8&#39;
    lc_messages=&#39;C&#39;
</code></pre></div>
<p>pgBadger parser do not support other locale like &#39;fr_FR.UTF-8&#39; for example.</p>
<h3>LOG STATEMENTS</h3>
<p>Considerations about log_min_duration_statement, log_duration and log_statement
configuration directives.</p>
<p>If you want the query statistics to include the actual query strings, you
must set log_min_duration_statement to 0 or more milliseconds.</p>
<p>If you just want to report duration and number of queries and don&#39;t want all
details about queries, set log_min_duration_statement to -1 to disable it and
enable log_duration in your postgresql.conf file. If you want to add the most
common request report you can either choose to set log_min_duration_statement
to a higher value or choose to enable log_statement.</p>
<p>Enabling log_min_duration_statement will add reports about slowest queries and
queries that took up the most time. Take care that if you have log_statement
set to &#39;all&#39; nothing will be logged with log_min_duration_statement.</p>
<p>Warning: Do not enable both log_min_duration_statement, log_duration and
log_statement all together, this will result in wrong counter values. Note
that this will also increase drastically the size of your log.
log_min_duration_statement should always be preferred.</p>
<h3>PARALLEL PROCESSING</h3>
<p>To enable parallel processing you just have to use the -j N option where N is
the number of cores you want to use.</p>
<p>pgBadger will then proceed as follow:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    for each log file
        chunk size = int(file size / N)
        look at start/end offsets of these chunks
        fork N processes and seek to the start offset of each chunk
            each process will terminate when the parser reach the end offset
            of its chunk
            each process write stats into a binary temporary file
       wait for all children has terminated
    All binary temporary files generated will then be read and loaded into
    memory to build the html output.
"><pre><code>    for each log file
        chunk size = int(file size / N)
        look at start/end offsets of these chunks
        fork N processes and seek to the start offset of each chunk
            each process will terminate when the parser reach the end offset
            of its chunk
            each process write stats into a binary temporary file
       wait for all children has terminated
    All binary temporary files generated will then be read and loaded into
    memory to build the html output.
</code></pre></div>
<p>With that method, at start/end of chunks pgBadger may truncate or omit a
maximum of N queries per log file which is an insignificant gap if you have
millions of queries in your log file. The chance that the query that you were
looking for is lost is near 0, this is why I think this gap is livable. Most
of the time the query is counted twice but truncated.</p>
<p>When you have many small log files and many CPUs it is speedier to dedicate
one core to one log file at a time. To enable this behavior you have to use
option -J N instead. With 200 log files of 10MB each the use of the -J option
starts being really interesting with 8 Cores. Using this method you will be
sure not to lose any queries in the reports.</p>
<p>He are a benchmark done on a server with 8 CPUs and a single file of 9.5GB.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="     Option |  1 CPU  | 2 CPU | 4 CPU | 8 CPU
    --------+---------+-------+-------+------
       -j   | 1h41m18 | 50m25 | 25m39 | 15m58
       -J   | 1h41m18 | 54m28 | 41m16 | 34m45
"><pre><code>     Option |  1 CPU  | 2 CPU | 4 CPU | 8 CPU
    --------+---------+-------+-------+------
       -j   | 1h41m18 | 50m25 | 25m39 | 15m58
       -J   | 1h41m18 | 54m28 | 41m16 | 34m45
</code></pre></div>
<p>With 200 log files of 10MB each and a total of 2GB the results are slightly
different:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="     Option | 1 CPU | 2 CPU | 4 CPU | 8 CPU
    --------+-------+-------+-------+------
       -j   | 20m15 |  9m56 |  5m20 | 4m20
       -J   | 20m15 |  9m49 |  5m00 | 2m40
"><pre><code>     Option | 1 CPU | 2 CPU | 4 CPU | 8 CPU
    --------+-------+-------+-------+------
       -j   | 20m15 |  9m56 |  5m20 | 4m20
       -J   | 20m15 |  9m49 |  5m00 | 2m40
</code></pre></div>
<p>So it is recommended to use -j unless you have hundreds of small log files
and can use at least 8 CPUs.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: when you are using parallel parsing pgBadger will generate a
lot of temporary files in the /tmp directory and will remove them at the
end, so do not remove those files unless pgBadger is not running. They are
all named with the following template tmp_pgbadgerXXXX.bin so they can be
easily identified.</p>
<h3>INCREMENTAL REPORTS</h3>
<p>pgBadger includes an automatic incremental report mode using option -I or
--incremental. When running in this mode, pgBadger will generate one report
per day and a cumulative report per week. Output is first done in binary
format into the mandatory output directory (see option -O or --outdir),
then in HTML format for daily and weekly reports with a main index file.</p>
<p>The main index file will show a dropdown menu per week with a link to each
week report and links to daily reports of each week.</p>
<p>For example, if you run pgBadger as follows based on a daily rotated file:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="0 4 * * * /usr/bin/pgbadger -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 -O /var/www/pg_reports/
"><pre><code>0 4 * * * /usr/bin/pgbadger -I -q /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log.1 -O /var/www/pg_reports/
</code></pre></div>
<p>you will have all daily and weekly reports for the full running period.</p>
<p>In this mode pgBadger will create an automatic incremental file in the
output directory, so you don&#39;t have to use the -l option unless you want
to change the path of that file. This means that you can run pgBadger in
this mode each day on a log file rotated each week, and it will not count
the log entries twice.</p>
<p>To save disk space you may want to use the -X or --extra-files command line
option to force pgBadger to write JavaScript and CSS to separate files in
the output directory. The resources will then be loaded using script and
link tags.</p>
<h4>Rebuilding reports</h4>
<p>Incremental reports can be rebuilt after a pgbadger report fix or a new
feature to update all HTML reports. To rebuild all reports where a binary
file is still present proceed as follow:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rm /path/to/reports/*.js
rm /path/to/reports/*.css
pgbadger -X -I -O /path/to/reports/ --rebuild
"><pre><code>rm /path/to/reports/*.js
rm /path/to/reports/*.css
pgbadger -X -I -O /path/to/reports/ --rebuild
</code></pre></div>
<p>it will also update all resource files (JS and CSS). Use -E or --explode
if the reports were built using this option.</p>
<h4>Monthly reports</h4>
<p>By default pgBadger in incremental mode only compute daily and weekly reports.
If you want monthly cumulative reports you will have to use a separate command
to specify the report to build. For example to build a report for August 2019:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger -X --month-report 2919-08 /var/www/pg_reports/
"><pre><code>pgbadger -X --month-report 2919-08 /var/www/pg_reports/
</code></pre></div>
<p>this will add a link to the month name into the calendar view of incremental
reports to look at monthly report. The report for a current month can be run
every day it is entirely rebuilt each time. The monthly report is not built by
default because it could take lot of time following the amount of data.</p>
<p>If reports were built with the per database option ( -E | --explode ) it must
be used too when calling pgbadger to build monthly report:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger -E -X --month-report 2919-08 /var/www/pg_reports/
"><pre><code>pgbadger -E -X --month-report 2919-08 /var/www/pg_reports/
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the same when using the rebuild option ( -R | --rebuild ).</p>
<h3>BINARY FORMAT</h3>
<p>Using the binary format it is possible to create custom incremental and
cumulative reports. For example, if you want to refresh a pgBadger
report each hour from a daily PostgreSQL log file, you can proceed by
running each hour the following commands:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pgbadger --last-parsed .pgbadger_last_state_file -o sunday/hourX.bin /var/log/pgsql/postgresql-Sun.log
"><pre><code>pgbadger --last-parsed .pgbadger_last_state_file -o sunday/hourX.bin /var/log/pgsql/postgresql-Sun.log
</code></pre></div>
<p>to generate the incremental data files in binary format. And to generate the fresh HTML
report from that binary file:</p>

<p>Or as another example, if you generate one log file per hour and you want
reports to be rebuilt each time the log file is rotated, proceed as
follows:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    pgbadger -o day1/hour01.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_10.log
    pgbadger -o day1/hour02.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_11.log
    pgbadger -o day1/hour03.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_12.log
    ...
"><pre><code>    pgbadger -o day1/hour01.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_10.log
    pgbadger -o day1/hour02.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_11.log
    pgbadger -o day1/hour03.bin /var/log/pgsql/pglog/postgresql-2012-03-23_12.log
    ...
</code></pre></div>
<p>When you want to refresh the HTML report, for example each time after a new binary file
is generated, just do the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    pgbadger -o day1_report.html day1/*.bin
"><pre><code>    pgbadger -o day1_report.html day1/*.bin
</code></pre></div>
<p>Adjust the commands to suit your particular needs.</p>
<h3>JSON FORMAT</h3>
<p>JSON format is good for sharing data with other languages, which makes it
easy to integrate pgBadger result into other monitoring tools like Cacti
or Graphite.</p>
