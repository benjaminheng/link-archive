<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>What’s new in v5</h2><h4>Code quality and rewrite in ES6</h4><p>The script is now distributed as an ES module and does not require a build step to use. <a href="https://photoswipe.com/getting-started">The documentation</a> is also updated and now includes more examples.</p><h4>Simpler initialization and dynamic import support</h4><p>PhotoSwipe now supports dynamic import and does not block page rendering.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span> </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>module</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Lightbox</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>&#39;./photoswipe-lightbox.esm.js&#39;</span><span>;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>const</span><span> lightbox </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Lightbox</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>  </span><span>gallery</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#39;#my-gallery&#39;</span><span>,</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>  </span><span>children</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#39;a&#39;</span><span>,</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>  </span><span>pswpModule</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>import</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;./photoswipe.esm.js&#39;</span><span>)</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span>lightbox</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br/></span><span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><br/></span></code></pre></div><h4>Animation and gesture engine update</h4><p>Improved performance of most animations, touch gestures should feel more fluid now. The initial opening or closing <a href="https://photoswipe.com/opening-or-closing-transition#animating-from-cropped-thumbnail">transition can be run from a CSS-cropped thumbnail</a>, as you can see on the top of this page.</p><h4>Single CSS file and no external assets</h4><p>Using CSS variables, default icons are dynamically generated and tiny.<br/><a href="https://photoswipe.com/styling">Styling guide →</a></p><h4>Built-in responsive images support</h4><p>PhotoSwipe also dynamically loads larger images as a user zooms via srcset.</p><h4>Open images in a zoomed state</h4><p>It&#39;s now much easier to control zoom level, refer to the <a href="https://photoswipe.com/adjusting-zoom-level">Adjusting Zoom Level</a> section of docs for more info. The example below opens images in a zoomed state and individually.</p><h4>Removed features from the core</h4><p>Some built-in features were removed in v5, either because they are using outdated technology or just rarely used. Some of them are or will be replaced by a plugin. These include:</p><ul><li>History API (#hash-based navigation is outdated)</li><li>Social sharing (unreliable URL, lack of Opengraph support)</li><li>Fullscreen button (rarely used, double fullscreen). <a href="https://photoswipe.com/native-fullscreen-on-open">Related example in docs →</a></li><li>Caption (accessibility problems). Refer to the <a href="https://photoswipe.com/caption">caption section of docs</a>.</li><li>Inline gallery support (v5 is mainly designed to be used as a dialog).</li></ul><h2>Plugins</h2><h4><a href="https://github.com/dimsemenov/photoswipe-dynamic-caption-plugin">Dynamic Caption plugin</a></h4><p>A plugin that dynamically positions the caption below or aside depending on the available free space.<br/></p><h4><a href="https://github.com/dimsemenov/photoswipe-deep-zoom-plugin">Tiled Deep Zoom plugin</a> (experimental)</h4><p>Tile-based image viewer that allows displaying of extremely large images. Unlike conventional tile-viewers (such as Leaflet or OpenSeaDragon) it displays tiles only after the user zooms beyond the primary image, and keeps all default PhotoSwipe navigation between slides.<br/></p><h2>License</h2><p>PhotoSwipe is free for personal or commercial projects (MIT license).<br/>Please <a href="https://opencollective.com/photoswipe">support the development on Open Collective</a> if you find it useful.</p></div></div>
