<p>I bet you’ve been looking forward to visiting some pubs in London ever since you booked your trip. But I know what you’re wondering…</p>
<p><em>“Do I tip the bartender?”</em><br/>
<em>“How do I order a drink?”</em></p>
<p>Not to worry. Here are some important things to know before you visit any pubs in London.</p>
<h3><strong>Place your order at the bar</strong></h3>
<p>For most pubs in London, you’re going to order your drinks at the bar, pay there, and take your drinks to your seat or wherever you’re standing. The same thing goes for when you order pub food too, unless there is a separate restaurant section, then you’ll have table service. When in doubt, just ask.</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t tip the bartenders</strong></h3>
<p>Americans, you’ll love this. Tipping in London is different than in the States. There’s no need to tip bartenders in pubs, or really any bars, in the UK. In fact, it would be a tad odd if you did.</p>
<h3><strong>Order beer and cider by the pint</strong></h3>
<p>It’s customary to order your beer or cider by the pint. Just say “can I get a pint of [drink]”? To give you an idea of how big that is, a pint of beer is 20 oz, or the size of a bottle of Coke for one person. You can also ask for a half-pint if you want something smaller. Most bars will also have bottled beer available too.</p>
<h3><strong>You can stand outside with your pint</strong></h3>
<p>When pubs in London start to get crowded, people just stand around with their drinks. When it’s a decent day outside, the crowds spill out to the streets and pavement surrounding the pub. You know it’s quittin’ time when you see lots of people outside with a pint in their hand.</p>
<p><em>Pin this, then keep reading…</em></p>

<h3><strong>Pubs in London are family affairs</strong></h3>
<p>Almost all pubs in London are family-friendly during the day. In fact it’s very common for parents to take their kids (and dogs!) to the pub for a Saturday or Sunday lunch. It feels more like a casual restaurant than a pub. If you really want to feel like a local, head to a pub with the whole family on the weekend!</p>
<h3><strong>Order drinks in rounds</strong></h3>
<p>When Londoners go to the pub together, they typically buy drinks in rounds, instead of everyone having to go up to the bar individually. If you’ve got a big group, you can see how it’d be easy to get drunk fairly quickly! You don’t have to do it this way, but it definitely makes it easier to get your drinks.</p>
<h3><strong>You can dress casually</strong></h3>
<p>Most pubs in London, especially during the day, are pretty casual in terms of what you wear. The only exception is when it starts to get later in the evening. You might see people dressed up for a night out, as they’ve planned to head to a club after the pub.</p>
<h3><strong>Seat yourself (in the bar area)</strong></h3>
<p>Pubs in London are generally a seat yourself thing, if you can find one. Some do let you call ahead and reserve a table, so you might see signs that say “reserved”. If you have a big group, call up to reserve a table if you can think that far ahead! Otherwise, just find yourself a spot when you get there.</p>
<h3><strong>Not all pubs in London are equal</strong></h3>
<p>There are all different types of pubs in London, from nicer Gastro pubs, to cheaper ones like <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs">Weatherspoons</a>. The quality of pub food will vary greatly, but you can’t really go wrong when it comes to ordering beer, wine and cider. Don’t stress too much about finding the perfect London pub to visit – just pop into one, have a drink, and you can always move on if you’re not into it.
