<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-test-id="comment"><p>Calling for yakuhai is often not worth it. A very common beginner (and even intermediate) mistake is to overvalue yakuhai. Many hands actually decrease in expected value if you call a yakuhai (since it is an exchange of one han for all of the potential han from a closed hand plus tanyao); while this will not be a mystery to most players who have been playing riichi for awhile, what players often miss is that <em>calling a yakuhai often does not speed up your hand</em>.</p><p>Another problem is that calling a yakuhai causes you to lose what are, in all likelihood, two safe discards, which you may need later. This problem is amplified by the fact that if you&#39;re running a hand that needs yakuhai, it&#39;s probably worth very little points, which means you&#39;ve just chucked a good source of defence in exchange for a hand that&#39;s probably not worth over 2000 points.</p><p>Open semipure hands are similarly not worth it a lot of the time because a) they&#39;re completely not subtle, meaning they&#39;re slower than they look since players will know how to not deal into you and b) they require you to discard two suits regardless of how your hand develops, making them even slower.</p><p>Open toitoi suffers from similar problems. The biggest problem with open toitoi is that by itself it isn&#39;t worth much and it combines very poorly with other yaku. Similarly, it&#39;s <em>really</em> shitty for defence because you&#39;re invariably going to have less tiles to choose from if shit gets too real and you have to abandon your hand. It&#39;s also fairly slow because although you can call from anyone, the population of useful tiles for you is quite narrow.</p><p>You probably shouldn&#39;t call tiles for yaku unless you&#39;re the dealer and/or your hand is big money.</p></div></div>
