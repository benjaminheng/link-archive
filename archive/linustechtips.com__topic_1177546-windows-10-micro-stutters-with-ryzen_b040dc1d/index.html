	Hi !
</p>

<p>
	<br/>
	I&#39;d this issue for more than 2 years, and i&#39;m a bit tired of it. It make no sens. Found no fix, nothing. I&#39;ve really weird random stutters at a system level. And when I say, it&#39;s random, it can be totaly fine few hours, and then it rebegins again. Or right at the start. All the system stutter for half a second, including the audio. The audio is very similar as if it&#39;s gonna BSOD. But it never does actually BSOD. It seems to not happen as often when the CPU is under heavy load and more when it&#39;s idling. But it still doing it here and there while gaming with no specific paterns to trigger the issue. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Ryzen. But this only happens with Ryzen&#39;s systems, and it&#39;s REALLY annoying.

	Troubleshooting / observation :
</p>



<p>
	- Chipset drivers updated.<br/>
	- BIOS updated.<br/>
	- Tried many parameters in BIOS, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br/>
	- Tried to change RAM kit and memory type.<br/>
	- Emptying standby memory. ( doesn&#39;t matter )<br/>
	- Zen, Zen+ and Zen 2 are affected. ( 2200G - Zen -, 2600 - Zen+ -, 3600 &amp; 3700X - Zen 2 ) <br/>
	- MB swapped.<br/>
	- CPUs upgrades ( Including new architecture )<br/>
	- Windows reset / fresh install. ( Even when windows have no modification, nothing installed, it still happen )<br/>
	- Power plans in windows 10 have no impact on the issue.<br/>
	- No overclock.<br/>
	- Graphics cards doesn&#39;t matter as far as I can see.<br/>
	- My mother have a 2200G. It also happen, but less frequently. I&#39;d a 2600 in the 2nd system with the same issue.<br/>
	- It&#39;s way more noticeable when I look at streams or videos.<br/>

	It seems that it&#39;s an issue with the ram and particular combo of CPU and MB. I could be wrong but for a time, i&#39;d a Ryzen 5 2600 in the 2nd system, with the same issue. I upgraded it the 3700X and I swapped the 2600 the 1st system, that was based on X99 ( intel ) previously ( It had no similar issues ). So I got myself a MSI B450 Tomahawk, stick my 32gb Corsair vengeance LPX 3000mhz that I had with my X99 system on it. This combo had no issues what so ever. Nothing. No sutters, buttery smooth. But as soon as I upgraded the 1st system with the 3600, it appears again, and it was worst, like the system was not even usable because of really bad stuttering. It got better with the actual kit of Trident Z Neo, but it still have theses weird stutters every X times.</p><p>
	
	To be clear, I&#39;ve nothing against Ryzen. But if I can get rid of theses stutters, that could be a much better experience.</p><p>
