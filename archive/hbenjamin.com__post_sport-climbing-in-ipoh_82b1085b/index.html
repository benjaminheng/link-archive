<p>About 3 weeks ago I went to Ipoh for rock climbing, and that marked the first
time I’ve ever climbed outdoors. It went amazing - made good friends, sent some
cool routes, and had good food! I expect I’ll be making more climbing trips in
the near future, so I figured I’ll start making a habit to do these trip
reports for each one.</p>
<p>I went as part of a group, organized by Derek from
<a href="http://www.rockerfellasadventure.com">Rockerfellas</a>. Here’s the <a href="http://www.rockerfellasadventure.com/event/ipoh-rock-trip-gunung-lang-2/">event
page</a>
for this trip, though we ended up doing some things differently from the posted
itinerary. There were ten of us, including our guide, Derek. Most of us were
climbing outdoors for the first time, though there were a couple people who
had prior experience.</p>
<h2 id="budget-sgd"><a href="#budget-sgd" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Budget (SGD)</h2>
<p>In total I spent about S$600 on the trip. Flights were $190 and the guide
package was $365, with the remainder spent on food and souvenirs.</p>
<h2 id="trip-length"><a href="#trip-length" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Trip length</h2>
<p>This was a short 3D2N weekend trip. We departed early Friday morning and
returned that Sunday evening. We managed to get in two full days of climbing,
plus a few hours on the last day before our flight.</p>
<h2 id="day-1----gunung-lang"><a href="#day-1----gunung-lang" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Day 1 – Gunung Lang</h2>
<p>Our flight arrived in Ipoh in the early morning. After getting some breakfast
we headed to the crag, where we climbed from 10am to 4pm. For the trip, Derek
had booked a private driver who shuttled us from place to place in his van.
Very convenient, and being a private hire (as opposed to a public bus) meant we
were never rushed for time.</p>
<p>The first area was <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oNLmQkCNbFwByWLp9">Gunung Lang Recreational
Park</a>. Limestone walls with
cliff-hanging trees. The rock is quite sharp with lots of little pointy
features jutting out, kind of like mini stalagmites. Surprisingly, the
rock features felt solid; I never felt like a hold was going to break off. The
routes here were about 25 meters long.</p>

<p>Despite being at the crag for about 6 hours, it didn’t feel too exhausting. A
good amount of time was spent just chatting with and getting to know one
another, since we’ve just met. The five to six hours of climbing time we had
was just nice!</p>
<p>Dinner for day 1 was at a somewhat upscale Chinese restaurant. Food was good,
but I’m generally not a foodie so I don’t have much of an opinion about it.
To cap off the day we went for a massage. I wasn’t really a fan of the massage
though, I’d probably skip it the next time I’m around.</p>
<h2 id="day-2----batu-kurau"><a href="#day-2----batu-kurau" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Day 2 – Batu Kurau</h2>
<p>On the second day we went to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sAypPky9hWDoyk578">Batu
Kurau</a>. The walls here are also
limestone, with very similar features to Gunung Lang. The holds here were
considerably sharper however. The routes here were shorter as well, with the
highest one we did being roughly 15 meters. There’s a 7a+ here, though I didn’t
manage to send it. Maybe next time!</p>

<p>This trip was my first time climbing outdoors, so I wasn’t sure what to expect.
I had some concerns about the difficulty of the climbs. My concerns were
unfounded though, as the two locations Derek brought us to had a perfect grade
range for the group of us.</p>
<p>For day 2 we continued the pattern of breakfast, climbing, lunch at the crag,
continue climbing, dinner, then back to the hotel to rest.</p>
<h2 id="day-3----gunung-lang-and-back-to-singapore"><a href="#day-3----gunung-lang-and-back-to-singapore" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Day 3 – Gunung Lang, and back to Singapore</h2>
<p>For day 3 we went back to Gunung Lang for a short session in the morning to
finish up any unclimbed routes. I quite enjoyed this <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/malaysia/route/1968707496">unnamed
route</a> we did;
it had a bouldery start into an easy finish.</p>
<p>After climbing we headed off to Concubine Lane for lunch. We walked around a
bit doing touristy stuff to kill some time, before heading off to the airport.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts" arialabel="Anchor"></a>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>I almost backed out of this trip due to the COVID-19 situation, but as the trip
date approached I felt that it wasn’t too bad yet so I decided to just go for
it. Three weeks later, as I’m writing this post, the pandemic has been steadily
worsening so I’m glad I took the opportunity to travel while the situation
allowed for it.</p>
<p>If I had to choose one thing I enjoyed most about the trip, it wouldn’t be the
climbing; it’s the friendships gained. It sounds cheesy, but I stand by that
statement.</p>
<p>Prior to the trip I had mostly done bouldering. Now however… I’m much more
interested in pursuing sport climbing alongside bouldering. Since getting back
Ipoh I’ve completed my SNCS Level 2 certification, and will soon start to sport
climb regularly as part of my gym sessions. I’m not yet sure what ratio of
sport climbing vs bouldering I’ll settle on, but we’ll see!</p>
<p>I created a <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climber/ben01">profile on thecrag.com</a> as
well! I’m looking forward to ticking more routes in the future.</p>
