<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div slot="what"><p>Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the <em>browser</em>, Svelte shifts that work into a <em>compile step</em> that happens when you build your app.</p>

		<p>Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.</p>

		<p>We&#39;re proud that Svelte was recently voted the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks">most loved web framework</a> with the <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/front-end-frameworks/">most satisfied developers</a> in a pair of industry surveys. We think you&#39;ll love it too. <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity">Read the introductory blog post</a> to learn more.</p></div></div>
