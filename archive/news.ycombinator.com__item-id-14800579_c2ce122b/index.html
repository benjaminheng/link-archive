      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Given the like natures of the people frequenting this board, I would imagine that I&#39;m not alone (hah) when dealing with loneliness.<p>I&#39;ve, over the past few years, grown more and more lonely with very little outside contact. My job does not interact with others much, topping out at the same few co-workers day in and day out.</p><p>I&#39;ve only ever had a small group of friends, which has grown even more thread-bare with age.</p><p>Besides &#34;go meet people&#34; (how?), how do the fine people of HN deal with loneliness? Especially in the case your quite introverted? I like being alone, just not all the time, and not to the point of despairing loneliness.</p><p>I reach out, for fear that it envelops me.</p></td></tr>
