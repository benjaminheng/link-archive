title: r/bikewrench - My rims are 17mm inside width. Can I really get away with up
  to a 700x37 tire (as seen on Sheldon Brown)?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="comment"><p>A 37mm tire would be fine.  That chart is fairly conservative, as it says in the caption.  I have run 2.35&#34; tires on 17mm and 19mm rims, as those used to be a fairly standard mtb rim sizes.  Also used up to 35mm on 15mm road rims.  Perhaps not ideal, but it worked just fine.  37mm (1.45&#34;) on 17mm rims isn&#39;t much of a stretch.  At worst, you would have a bit of squirm or folding on hard corners and low pressures, but probably not enough to be a significant issue.</p></div></div>
