<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="comment"><p>Perfectly okay!</p><p>So, you’re going to want to know: the frame’s bottom bracket shell standard, the head tube diameter and recommended headset type, and dropout spacing. This will be on your frame sheet.</p><p>Start with sheldonbrown.com to look up, read about, and understand those terms.</p><p>In addition, you’re going to want to be at least casually familiar with the term chain line.</p><p>Caution: my first frame-up build required the advice and occasional assistance of a friend who owns a shop, and a significant investment in tools. Namely: a tap for chasing the bb threads, a bb installation tool, a headset installation tool, a cassette lock ring tool, a chain whip, a good set of metric hex wrenches (Wera), grease, carbon grip compound, a 1/4 torque wrench, a 3/8” torque wrench, hex bits for the torque wrenches, a steer tube cutting guide, a cable/housing cutter, torx drivers, a park repair guide, a used Barnett’s manual, and a used repair stand. Don’t forget blue locktite for your chainring bolts.</p><p>It’s possible to acquire these tools over time, but not having them if you’re attempting to build from a new frame will be significantly challenging and frustrating.</p><p>It’s a ton of fun to build your own ride, but the learning curve can be a little steep your first time :-)</p></div></div>
