                <a href="https://github.com/cyclosm/cyclosm-cartocss-style/">CyclOSM</a> is a bicycle-oriented map built on top of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. It aims at providing a beautiful and practical map for cyclists, no matter their cycling habits or abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In urban areas, it renders the main different types of cycle tracks and lanes, on each side of the road, for helping you draw your bike to work route. It also features essential POIs as well as bicycle parking spots or spots shared with motorbikes, specific infrastructure (elevators / ramps), road speeds or surfaces to avoid streets with pavings, bumpers and bike boxes, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same map also lets you visualize main bicycle touring routes as well as essential POIs when touring (emergency services, shelters, tourism, shops).
            </p>
            <p>
                We offer three different map styles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>default CyclOSM</strong> style, fit for most applications <a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> and map purposes (tiles can be cached for up to a few hours <a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>);</li>
                <li>The <strong>CyclOSM live</strong> style, fit for OpenStreetMap contributors (tiles are always minute updated) and available only at <a href="https://cyclosm.org/">cyclosm.org</a> and in contributions tools;</li>
                <li>The <strong>CyclOSM lite</strong> variant, meant to be used as an overlay map to turn any map style into a bike map.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                [4] OpenStreetMap data should be replicated in near realtime CyclOSM style, the current delay between OpenStreetMap data and our maintained version can be seen <a href="https://munin.openstreetmap.fr/osm11.openstreetmap.fr/osm165.openstreetmap.fr/osm_replication_lag_osm2pgsql.html">here</a>. Tiles below zoom level 12 are pre-generated on a weekly basis, tiles at higher zooms are live-generated and then cached for up to 72 hours (except for the <em>live</em> variant).
