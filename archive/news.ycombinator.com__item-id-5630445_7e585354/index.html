It&#39;s the result of a negative prediction error in the nucleus accumbens.  You effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure.</i></p><p><i>Subconsciously, then eventually, consciously, you wonder if it&#39;s worth it.  The best way to prevent burnout is to follow up a serious failure with doing small things that you know are going to work.  As a biologist, I frequently put in 50-70 and sometimes 100 hour workweeks.  The very nature of experimental science (lots of unkowns) means that failure happens. The nature of the culture means that grad students are &#34;groomed&#34; by sticking them on low-probability of success, high reward fishing expeditions (gotta get those nature, science papers) I used to burn out for months after accumulating many many hours of work on high-risk projects. I saw other grad students get it really bad, and burn out for years.</i></p><p><i>During my first postdoc, I dated a neuroscientist and reprogrammed my work habits.  On the heels of the failure of a project where I have spent weeks building up for, I will quickly force myself to do routine molecular biology, or general lab tasks, or a repeat of an experiment that I have gotten to work in the past. These all have an immediate reward.  Now I don&#39;t burn out anymore, and find it easier to re-attempt very difficult things, with a clearer mindset.</i></p><p><i>For coders, I would posit that most burnout comes on the heels of failure that is not in the hands of the coder (management decisions, market realities, etc).  My suggested remedy would be to reassociate work with success by doing routine things such as debugging or code testing that will restore the act of working with the little &#34;pops&#34; of endorphins.</i></p><p><i>That is not to say that having a healthy life schedule makes burnout less likely (I think it does; and one should have a healthy lifestyle for its own sake) but I don&#39;t think it addresses the main issue.</i></p><p>Then I finally realized how many times I&#39;ve burnt out in my life, and I became much better into avoiding it. Which is really hard to do.</p><p>And it seems to me that this is one of the many points that Ben Horowitz talks about on his <i>Whatâ€™s The Most Difficult CEO Skill? Managing Your Own Psychology</i>[3]</p><p>[1] <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Burnout-is-caused-by-resentment.html" rel="nofollow">http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Burnout-is-caused-by-resentment...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Burnout-is-caused-by-resentment.html#comment-478842490" rel="nofollow">http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Burnout-is-caused-by-resentment...</a></p><p>[3] <a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2011/04/01/what%E2%80%99s-the-most-difficult-ceo-skill-managing-your-own-psychology/" rel="nofollow">http://bhorowitz.com/2011/04/01/what%E2%80%99s-the-most-diff...</a>

Thank you for helping me realize I was wrong.<p>So much of what security folks do everyday results in push back and delaying tactics that it eventually ends in failure or very small wins. It&#39;s easy to get burned out because of the perceived failure and I see the effects of it all around. Celebrating even the tiniest of wins makes complete sense.

Also getting some sunshine now and again doesn&#39;t hurt.<p>Another biggie for me:</p><p>Unplugging from (stuff like) Facebook I think can also help prevent the false perception that everybody is having a way better time than I am.  I think it&#39;s less effort to unplug than to have to constantly remind myself that everybody is putting on their happy faces on when it comes to social networking.

This behavior makes sense, because my FB news feed depresses me and augments any bit of subconscious insecurity I&#39;ve willed myself to ignore. Except I deal with it by unplugging from FB, whereas the aforementioned type of person would overcompensate by ignoring the news feed, posting about their great life and garnering attention. This would be an interesting psychological study to read about.

At a big company, if you&#39;re smart, work hard, and do what tasks are assigned to you, chances are you&#39;ll have a long and profitable career. Fresh out of school, a smart and motivated engineer could expect to make say $750,000 - $1,500,000 over five years working there, with almost no personal risk. Over their career, at present value, probably pushing to $10 million.<p>If you start a company, however, your returns vary extensively. If you&#39;re smart and dedicated after five years you might come out broke - or even in debt. Or you&#39;ll come out being barely able to make the rent. Or you&#39;ll be a millionaire or billionaire. As an entrepreneur, your risk five year returns would be somewhere between -$100,000 to $10,000,000+, with the expectation I would guess quite a bit lower than the Googler&#39;s.</p><p>That&#39;s not to say that either is the right choice - mathematically, the big corporation choice will make you more money in the expectation and probably take less of your time. But you know, life&#39;s not about optimizing the integral of income over your career.

If you&#39;re smart, work hard, and do what tasks are assigned to you, you&#39;ll top out at SWE3 with a salary in the low six-figures.  Getting promoted to Senior SWE requires selecting the right projects and some degree of leadership and organizational awareness.  Getting promoted to Staff or above <i>also</i> requires sticking your neck out to promote some initiatives that may be controversial, and convincing people to go along with you.  This is not all that different from the skillset required to be an entrepreneur.<p>That&#39;s why I suggested picking a big corporation with more of a reputation for &#34;doing what you&#39;re told&#34;, like IBM, Cisco, or even Apple.  Google in a couple years might be there, but right now you <i>cannot</i> get to the higher engineering levels without sticking your neck out on an initiative that may be controversial at first.</p><p>(It&#39;s also true that the risk/reward curve is flattened a bit at Google than at a startup: at Google, you&#39;re still being paid a relatively fat salary if your high-risk project fails, you just don&#39;t advance.  And if it succeeds, you end up with a raise and a promotion, not F-U money [usually].  But this article is about the emotional aspects of failure, not the financial ones, and those are still just as relevant at fast-growers as at startups.)

It&#39;s the result of a negative prediction error in the nucleus accumbens. You effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure.</i><p>Wow. Fuck. That is spot-on. Just... fuck! You nailed it.</p><p>I feel like I&#39;ve been badly conditioned over the past few years. I&#39;ve worked on failed software projects (only one my fault, years ago and I didn&#39;t know what I was doing) and in bad managerial environments, and I&#39;ve never experienced team synergy or symbiotic management-- I know it exists, but it hasn&#39;t been my experience. Yet as an almost-succeeded creative writer, I&#39;m really good at kvetching because I can capture peoples&#39; complaints in a way that almost no one else can. I&#39;m terrified of conditioning myself out of tech just by being so much better at kvetching (I can write a top comment on almost any forum).</p><p>I don&#39;t <i>failure</i> is that bad. I&#39;m old enough to realize that good ideas fail for all kinds of reasons, and that it&#39;s pointless to get married to an idea, a project, or even a job. I can hack failure. It comes with the territory. Scrap the old project, start a new one. Most people who achieve great things were much bigger failures than I am, up until a couple years before the &#34;overnight success&#34;.</p><p>What really drives the nail in is the low social status that comes with failure. Project cancelled? Ok, fine. Is it a transfer or a layoff? Just let me know and be fair about it, and we&#39;re cool. Lose a job? That happens. Dealing with humiliation afterward-- applying for subordinate roles for which I&#39;m way overqualified, having to go through 47 goddamn phone screens for each company just to prove I&#39;m not an idiot-- is harder. It doesn&#39;t help that we&#39;re a tribe (technologists, software engineers) with extremely low social status (especially per IQ point) in comparison to project managers and bike-shedding executives.</p><p>I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s the association of hard work with failure itself that&#39;s so devastating, but the association of it with <i>low social status</i> is, I think, what drives so many people out of our industry before age 35. Project failure would be okay if it wasn&#39;t so devastating to our social status, especially in an industry where ageism begins at 27. Then, we see people of mediocre talent and work ethic getting ahead (including $200M+ acq-hires) on social polish and it&#39;s just more demoralizing.

In other countries with superior medical system integration, like Austria/Germany, this is an accepted medical fact.<p>If you stress out a rat long enough, its adrenal glands will actually bleed. If you stress out a human long enough, you cause first a huge ongoing spike in cortisol etc., and later, a serious drop as the damage is done. This can be measured easily using a 24-hour cortisol saliva or blood test, but it rarely is. (Related hormones: DHEA, thyroid).</p><p>Symptoms of burnout are just like the symptoms of CFS/low thyroid because they are part of the HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenals) Axis. They&#39;re tightly coupled.</p><p>While short bursts of endorphins will make you feel better, the effect will be temporary. Endorphins will not make your adrenal glands or thyroid work again. Instead, they mask the symptomsâ€¦ but only for a while. There are only three ways to get better: Dramatically cut stress. Wait. Take medication. Pick 2.</p><p>[1] &#34;Sub-clinical&#34; usually means &#34;not measurable,&#34; but in the case of &#34;burnout&#34; and adrenal fatigue, it is absolutely measurable. However, I call it sub-clinical because of the way most doctors think of the adrenal glands. Most doctors believe that the adrenal glands are binary: they are either working perfectly, or totally non-functional (Addison&#39;s disease). Unless you&#39;re on the verge of death from lack of cortisol, they will tell you you&#39;re fine.</p><p>If you have burnout, get your 24-hour saliva test. Take your morning temperature with an old-fashioned thermometer under your arm for 10 min. Look up the other symptoms of adrenal fatigue and hypothyroid. There&#39;s plenty of research published about how burnout is measurable and related to the HPA axis -- you don&#39;t have to take my word for it. There are lots of support groups, too, where the sufferers have often presaged the research.</p><p>And for god&#39;s sake, stop telling yourself it&#39;s about failure or investment or whatever and <i>stop stressing yourself out, period</i>, or you can get like I am and it can become <i>permanent</i>.</p><p>EDIT: If you google &#34;burnout syndrome&#34; you will read several sources claiming that there is no proof it&#39;s a real thing. This is 100% false. They also say it&#39;s not accepted by the medical community, but rather a quacky way to sell supplements. It&#39;s true that most doctors are unaware of the research, but the ones who do treat it with real medicine (see below).</p><p>It&#39;s painfully easy to say &#34;There&#39;s no proof&#34; but a 5-minute search of Google Scholar shows otherwise:</p><p><a href="http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/61/2/197.short" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/61/2/197.short</a> (from 1999!)</p><p><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;UID=2005-13290-009" rel="nofollow">http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;...</a></p><p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399999000070" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399999...</a></p><p><a href="http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/62/2/286.short" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/62/2/286.short</a></p><p><a href="http://gimle.fsm.it/28/1s_psi/05.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://gimle.fsm.it/28/1s_psi/05.pdf</a></p><p>The theories from doctors who&#39;ve spent their lifetime researching it go as follows: Burnout happens in stages. In the early stages, cortisol etc. are elevated. In the later stages, the &#34;fatigue&#34; sets in, and cortisol is too low. I personally spent 3+ months in low-cortisol hell and it was the most awful time in my lifeâ€¦ and there have been some really bad times in my life. .</p><p>And there are quite a lot of endocrinologists etc. who will treat low-testing cortisol patients with hydrocortisone, isocort or florinef or other <i>drugs</i> which are not &#34;supplements&#34; by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>IF you are stressing yourself out, and IF you keep going down that road, this is what you have to look forward to:</p><p>Being unable to get out of bed. Being unable to make the simplest of decisions without feeling like you&#39;re having a panic attack. Being unable to read, because it&#39;s too much information at once. Being unable to watch TV shows that have too many &#34;facts&#34; in them. All of the above -- including simple questions of &#34;What do you want for lunch, honey?&#34; -- triggered panic-like attacks in me, who&#39;d never had a panic attack despite years of physical and emotional abuse as a child. It was like being surrounded and squeezed and shouted at by a million people all at once, just to try to <i>listen to my lunch options</i>. That is because cortisol is required to rise to the &#34;stress&#34; of every day livingâ€¦ standing up from sitting is a stress, making decisions, etc., all create tiny spikes of cortisol to help you cope. If your cortisol is too low, you are screwed.</p><p>Is there any &#34;victory&#34; worth a life like that? Can you even call that a life?

Which may be true, but getting out of the bed currently IS an exercise for me. It is getting better though, two months after quitting my job - I can even enjoy Hacker News again.</p><p>Since you&#39;ve gone down this path, what would you suggest? I am having a hard time convincing any doctors to do a more complete examination. I was going to focus next on sleep disorders, but now I think it might be worth talking to an endocrinologist...

When I was over the worst of it, if I would walk two or three blocks to the store, I would feel like I had been hit by a truck for <i>days</i> afterwards. Even years later, I came within a hairs&#39; breadth of passing out doing nothing more strenuous than walking around the ground floor of a museum. Never before in my life had I ever fainted, before I got sick. This is a physical ailment, caused by low blood pressure, disordered autonomic nervous system response, a lack of muscle energy replenishment that is characteristic of CFS/FM, etc.</p><p>You also wrote that you couldn&#39;t stop thinking. When you have what I have, thinking is almost as difficult as physical activity.</p><p>Depression vs CFS is the difference being out of gas, and an engine that is rusted solid.</p><p>That doesn&#39;t mean your experience wasn&#39;t equally terrible in different ways. Your car still wouldn&#39;t go. It&#39;s an issue of terminology, we only have so many words.

Some studies find low cortisol, others don&#39;t. There is definitely HPA axis dysfunction, but nobody can seem to pin it down. I suspect that if you measured cortisol throughout the day and correlated it to a symptom diary and/or a stress test, you might be able to come up with a diagnostic test.<p>The other issue is that there is no cheap and easy cortisol test like there is for blood glucose. As far as I can tell it would be possible to develop such a test, but nobody has done it yet for a number of reasons (lack of demand, cost, FDA approval, etc).</p><p>If someone were to [1] figure out a definitive test for burnout/CFS and [2] develop/patent a home testing kit they would be very rich and help a lot of people into the bargain.</p><p>As for Teitelbaum: while he does have some useful stuff to say, he also peddles a lot of quackery.

I&#39;ve seen studies that show that burnout is caused by sustained imbalance between your personal goals and how you&#39;re living your life. This can also happen retro actively. For example, if you were to find out that you weren&#39;t going to get paid for a job you&#39;d been working the last 6 months on, you would almost instantly be burned out. That is, if you were doing it for the money of course. Your personal goal is to spend a certain percentage of your time on things that will increase your wealth, and if you weren&#39;t to get paid, the sudden overwhelming sense of losing six months would burn you out immediately.<p>Likewise in a startup, I think the studies would say that you find yourself burned out because at some point, something inside you says, &#34;80 hours a week for the last year wasn&#39;t really completely in line with all my personal goals. I have a goal to have personal relationships, spend time with my family, and exercise, yet this startup is the only thing I&#39;ve been doing.&#34; At some point a voice inside says, &#34;It wasn&#39;t worth it.&#34;</p><p>People have very different goals, so results will vary as to what causes burnout, but as a boss, something I know will cause burnout is anything that will pull the rug out from under an employee regarding benefits that they expected to receive. For startups this is super tricky because some employees are expecting an IPO with big payouts, and when they get disillusioned about that, there&#39;s really no way to stop the burnout.

instituting a &#34;hard stop&#34; can go a long way, it did for me. i&#39;ve spent 12-15hrs at the office, per day, dealing with meetings, questions, providing guidance and the like.
eventually you must put you interests first. whether it&#39;s picking up that book, working on that personal project, or calling that friend who works in a different field.
ultimately, the problems are not crazy new, but it&#39;s the day to day that burns people out. there&#39;s knowledge to be shared but when you feel like day in and day out it&#39;s the same old, then all the more reason to institute basic guides/metrics that let us know things are on track.
