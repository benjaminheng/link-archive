The actual work itself varies from stupid easy to relatively challenging, but again, I just can’t bring myself to care beyond ensuring my team doesn’t think I suck at my job so I can keep collecting my paycheck. All I’m doing is running out the clock every single day.<p>That’s why I’m burnt out.

It crops up whenever I stop coding on the side, for fun, for more than a month. The playfulness just gets lost over time.<p>Last week my motivation went to almost 0, and it took me a while until I discovered the why: I had been stunned by the SwiftUI demos, and wanted to get my hands dirty. But I hadn&#39;t had ANY time to dabble around because I had overburdened myself with promises to various customers. What I did felt very far away from what I actually wanted to do, and it got worse every day.</p><p>When I finally understood what the problem was, motivation started to come back. I played around with SwiftUI for only 5 minutes yesterday, and feel so much better already.</p><p>Do you have a side project that you would love to spend all your time on? (doesn&#39;t have to be coding)

                  <p><span>That&#39;s not a very nice thing to say. I am in the position where I could take your advice but for many folks there is no plausible solution. Sure, anyone could fuck off to the woods, open a fruit stand, and tell their spouse and children to suck it up and college is overrated anyway. But what if your spouse doesn&#39;t want to live behind a fruit stand in the woods? What if you have to support a family and the pay ceiling for your profession doesn&#39;t allow you to save enough money to retire early? What if you&#39;re already closing in on 50? It&#39;s easy to tell people they just need a plan, but everybody has their own unique problems and it&#39;s a bit rude to imply that it&#39;s their own fault because they didn&#39;t work hard enough. GP could have made a plan to retire at 35 and sail around the world, pinched their pennies, and saved up a million bucks, then their child got cancer or something else equally horrible. Or maybe you&#39;re right and they spent all of their discretionary income on magic the gathering cards. Point is, we don&#39;t know and it&#39;s not nice to tell random strangers on the internet to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.</span></p></div></td></tr>

You&#39;ll find they have no arguments,  overuse authority arguments and blindly follow the gospel of well-known programming books. Once at that point, quietly extricate yourself from the conversation and start sending out CVs.</p><p>These kind of people will fuck your shit up if you let them or can&#39;t find a way to limit your interaction with them.

Often the correct path is just to quit though.

He had a string of victories and also suffered incredible losses including the loss of an eye to infection.</p><p>Despite that he led his men and was incredibly popular. After laying waste to the Italian countryside for two decades he was reluctantly recalled back to Carthage where he served as a statesman for several more years.</p><p>He was then exiled and a price put on his head and he made plans to ally himself with other leaders of the day - honestly his life goes on and on. The guy&#39;s resiliency is incredible and he isn&#39;t the only one of his age. There are numerous examples of similar people from the history of the time.</p><p>I suppose your modern day cases like Musk or Jobs are what we&#39;d think of today. The former&#39;s challenges are well documented but the latter had just months to turnaround a sinking Apple and restructure the company before it ran out of money. He&#39;d been through many ups and downs and again displayed a resiliency which is pretty remarkable.</p><p>I think that everyone&#39;s ability to handle stress varies. What I&#39;d love to know is why some people can suffer incredibly and not only survive but thrive and if there is some way in which we can learn how to suffer the everyday arrows slung our way and bear our burdens better.

I am often amazed by how the executives I meet genuinely seem to lack the ability to self-criticize and admit wrongdoing, even in personal settings. For great leaders, the worldly rewards and affirmation in the form of praise are never ending. This makes individuals highly resilient to external stress.

There are other symptoms, like a state of constant exhaustion, a reduced immune system and a profound sense of loss, which given the above would seem only natural.<p>I realize this is only anecdotal evidence, but I&#39;ve seen enough of it in people who are diagnosticized with burn-out to be frustrated that these aspects are not given enough coverage. The description I often hear is that of relatively mild symptoms, bordering on simulation.</p><p>As for &#34;from 30-40&#34;: I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve encountered people with (this kind of) burn-out younger than that. I believe it is because younger people are stronger and more resilient physically in general. That&#39;s not to say young people should over-use their resources at will: if they have acquired that habit then they will be at serious risk when older I think.</p><p>There are probably as many different reasons and dynamic behind every single burn-out as there are people. The thing I wanted to point out was my own observation that the kind of brain damage that I seem to detect among burn-out victims has always been preceded by several consecutive nights without sleep because of stress. It is not not backed by large cohort studies (as far as I know), it&#39;s just my observation.

You&#39;re more likely to be a complete liability, because you&#39;re tired, unfocussed and not capable of thinking straight.  Doing this for a week or more is a recipe for disaster.  As for this leading to &#34;more decision power&#34; than people who chose not to indulge in such antics, I&#39;ve yet to see this in any role I&#39;ve been in in the last 20+ years.  Most places would not see such behaviour as a positive, either for you or your place in the team and organisation.</p><p>The human body is not a machine.  We can&#39;t work long hours without significant mental and physical impairment.  I&#39;ve worked 12 hour day and night shifts, and seen the effects on me and the others around me.  Extreme tiredness and disrupted body clocks lead to careless, stupid and costly mistakes.  We were never meant to work such gruelling hours.  I&#39;ve worked 36 hours straight in a research laboratory.  I was destroyed for several days following, wiping out any benefit of the effort I&#39;d put in.  And I made a silly mistake 32 hours in, ruining the whole experiment, due to one moment of inattention after 12 hours straight intense focus.  Individual &#34;superhuman effort&#34; does not beat effective planning and efficient use of time and teamworking.  Which is why so few companies want to rely on primadonnas, and instead want reliable and predictable people who won&#39;t flake out.</p><p>Today, I work regular office hours.  Work hard while I&#39;m there, and start and leave bang on time each day.  I&#39;m much better for it in all respects.  And if you don&#39;t want to get severe RSI and burnout, I&#39;d suggest at least considering these points.  I didn&#39;t until I was severely affected by both, and it was not at all fun.

I have seen that the HN community has some management/strategy consultants. I&#39;ve also seen that if you work at an MBB firm, you basically are guaranteed to work 60+ hours, especially in the first 3 years.<p>I might give this to a couple of MBB acquaintances I know and see how they react, but I find it odd that these industries ignore this. From my (perhaps naive perspective), it simply isn&#39;t profitable to ignore this and moreover also unscientific (I had the impression that some finance-based industries were pretty pin point accurate with things).</p><p>(I secretly hope we have a 60+ hour working person reading this)

I ended up getting cancer, light sensitivity, and my sleep schedule was difficult to get back into sync. I was also trying to get my team to work less hours because my whole team was being burned out however I wasn&#39;t getting support from my management team at the time. I ended up with a new director, a new team as most of my prior team left, a promotion, and proper time to recover from the burnout. It took a few months but I was able to work my way back from it.<p>I&#39;m now approaching a different kind of malaise as with numerous management changes our work has appeared to become unimportant to our upper management and I suspect they will be handing it over to a team openly hostile to what we do and completely unequipped for the job. As much as I need healthcare to live I&#39;m not willing to spend what are most likely my final years in a place that I don&#39;t think cares about our customers.</p><p>All this is to say that there are most definitely different kinds of burnout. One is more physical, the other is emotional. Both impact your mental facilities and ability to get work done. Both directly work on morale, which is why the solution to burnout in employees is to discover what&#39;s crushing their morale. If people are passionate and care personally about what they do because they know they are performing important work as part of a unified vision then extra work won&#39;t result in burnout. This isn&#39;t to say that you should allow your employees to be constantly overworked, just that if occasional extra work is needed, if you&#39;ve done your job appropriately as a manager the impact is severely less and the cancer if negative thinking doesn&#39;t start to creep in. Once that does it&#39;s nearly impossible to rectify unless you&#39;re very good at rebuilding empowerment.

Everyone has some creativity but I’m specifically talking about “artists”.</p><p>2 - Not being paid enough. Everything is relative. For some people “hustling” even if they’re making 1% salaries is too much. I think that the perspective would be changed if one was a C-suite level or a founder of that same company. We see this in Wall Street too, and nearly ever power law job. Most people, particularly blue collar workers, work physically backbreaking hours doing physically backbreaking work. They can’t afford the luxury of burnout. There’s maybe a large middle class band where people can. For people beyond that, maybe even on the higher end of upper middle class, they’re being compensated enough so the psychological checks and balances compute well enough that burnout doesn’t manifest like how it does for others.</p><p>I’d also argue that the optics of “success/growth at all costs” are falsely blamed in SV in particular because SV has a “fail upwards” mechanism that rewards failures.</p><p>Lastly, I think that stagnation is not the same thing as burnout.
