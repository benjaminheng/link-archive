<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><p>There’s a lot of confusion on bottom brackets, as you would expect with anything with a dozen competing ‘standards’. I’ve put together a visual guide to help explain things. The intention here is to help you understand the terminology of bottom brackets. People always come in and say “Will X bottom bracket work with Y” frame without providing the right details, so I hope to help clarify bottom brackets.</p><p>First of all, what is the bottom bracket? It’s probably one of the most important parts of your bike that you can’t see. It’s the bearing assembly that attaches your crankset to your frame. These bearings need to allow the cranks to rotate (upwards of 100 RPM when you’re really spinning), and they also need to be able to support your entire body weight when you are standing on the pedals. When you’re sprinting out of the saddle, at high speed, and hit a bump, your trusty little bottom bracket is making sure that the cranks can keep spinning despite a tremendous load being reacted through them.</p><p>The important part of bottom bracket compatibility, if you only remember one thing from reading this, is that your bottom bracket needs to interface to your frame and be compatible with the frame, and it also needs to interface with your crankset and be compatible with that. Both of those two pieces of information are what is necessary to figure out what bottom bracket you require – it’s not possible to say “I have a SRAM GXP crankset, what BB do I need?” or “I have a BB86 frame, what BB do I need?”. You’re only providing half the information in each case – you need to know what your crankset interface standard is, and your frame interface is, and pick the bottom bracket that works with both. To back off, let me introduce some terminology.</p><ul><li><p>Bottom Bracket (BB): This is the bearing assembly. Occasionally, the spindle is also part of this, but in most modern / higher end cranks, it’s not. This is the replaceable unit, it’s not part of your frame or your cranks.</p></li><li><p>Bottom Bracket Shell: This is the part of your frame that holds the bottom bracket in place. It’s the junction of your down tube, seat tube, and chainstays. On metal bikes, it’s typically a separate, large metal tube that is perpendicular to all of the other tubes. On carbon bikes, there’s often a large junction where the down tube, seat tube, and chainstays blend together. See <a href="https://ibb.co/kCMJpd" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">here</a></p></li><li><p>Spindle: This is the ‘axle’, so to speak, that connects the left side crank arm to the right side crank arm. In some older stuff (Square taper, ISIS) it’s part of the bottom bracket and can’t be removed. In most modern / higher end stuff, it’s either a separate piece, or it’s permanently affixed to one of the crank arms. See <a href="https://ibb.co/eo6jUd" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">here</a></p></li><li><p>Crank arms: These are the arms that attach to the pedals. They’re various lengths (typically 165-175mm, but there are larger/smaller sizes available), and usually have a standard 9/16” pedal thread, which is left-threaded on the left side.</p></li><li><p>Q-Factor: This is the total width of the crankset. It’s a combination of how wide the bottom bracket is, and how far the crank arms curve away from the bottom bracket. Generally, people try to get a narrower Q factor. With mountain bikes, usually a wider Q-factor is necessary, because otherwise the cranks would hit the chainstays (which are wider apart to accommodate a large MTB tire)</p></li><li><p>Spider: This is the interface between the crank arms and the chainrings. It can attach to the right side of the spindle, or to the right side crank arm, or often it is integral to the right side crank arm. The spider has a set of 4 or 5 bolts that attach the chainring. These bolts are sort of standardized with a Bolt Circle Diameter (BCD) that says how far they are from the centerline of the crank. There are typically either 5 evenly spaced bolts, or 4 bolts that may or may not be evenly spaced (yay, marginal gains and annoying incompatibilities!). In some cases (triples), a crankset will have a certain BCD for the middle and big ring, then another set of bolts for the granny ring. You need to match BCD when shopping for chainrings.</p></li><li><p>Chainrings: These are the rings that hold your chain, duh. Typically they are sold as a set of 1, 2, or 3 rings. They have a certain number of teeth (more teeth = bike goes faster but is harder to pedal). There is also a minimum number of teeth for a given BCD chainring, because you need the chainring to be large enough to mount to the crankset (i.e. you can’t have a 125mm diameter chainring on a 130mm BCD crankset). In practice, old school ‘standard’ road cranks are 130mm (smallest available ring is a 39T, although I’ve heard that a 38T could fit but isn’t readily available), and most ‘compact’ road cranks are 110mm (smallest available ring is a 34T, with rumors that a 33T could fit but no one makes one). Lately, many manufacturers are moving towards using 110mm for everything. It should also be noted that there are also “Direct Mount” chainrings that are a combined chainring and spider, so they attach right to the spindle with a splined interface. They are more expensive and only work on certain cranksets, but they are nice looking and you don’t have to worry about matching BCD.</p></li></ul><p><strong>1990s: Threaded Shells &amp; Square Taper</strong></p><p>Okay, now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s go back to what we were talking about. Basically, prior to about 20 years ago, bottom brackets sat in a threaded BB shell on your frame and had a spindle built in. There are various threading types (English aka ‘BSA’, Italian, French, and probably a couple other ones I’ve never heard of ). There are also various spindle types (Square Taper being the most common, but having both ISO and JIS variants, and then in later years Octalink and the unfortunately-named ISIS came on the scene). There have also been advances in bearings over the years – older BBs had loose ball bearings you could take apart to clean and re-grease, modern ones have sealed bearings. If you’re interested in any of this, Sheldon Brown has a far more complete website than I could ever put together: <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/bbsize.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">http://www.sheldonbrown.com/bbsize.html</a></p><p><a href="https://ibb.co/mQynhy" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">This</a> is what a threaded BB looks like. They are available in various spindle lengths, which need to be matched to the recommended spindle for your crank arms (but can be tweaked, for instance if your chainring is hitting the chainstay, you could get a slightly longer spindle which will increase Q-factor but give you additional clearance). It’s a sealed bearing. The crank arms have a square cutout and bolt onto the square tapered areas on either end of the spindle. The bottom bracket itself is threaded into the frame with a tool that fits into the internal splines. The spindle is relatively narrow (I can’t find any numbers, but eyeballing it I’d guess like 18-20mm) and is made out of solid steel. The standard threaded BB shell is about 68mm wide and 34mm diameter.</p><p><strong>2004: Hollowtech II goes outboard</strong></p><p>This was all well and good, but people wanted to find a way to make things lighter. Around 2004 or so, Shimano introduced the Dura-Ace 7800 groupset, and Hollowtech II (side note, I have no idea if Hollowtech 1 was ever a thing, nothing Shimano can come up with in terms of back-asswards naming schemes would surprise me anymore. Edit - Hollowtech 1 means hollow crank arms. Every Hollowtech crank is also Hollowtech 2 spindle, but not every crank with Hollowtech 2 spindle has hollow arms l. The Tiagra and lesser stuff is a C shaped solid arm). This had a couple major changes that have percolated through the rest of the industry. The spindle is now part of the right side crank arm, as well as the spider. The spindle is a larger diameter (24mm), but it’s now hollow (part of the “lighter and stiffer” marketing). This presented a problem, as it ate into the space available for the bearings (yeah, those bearings that are designed to spin at 100 RPM while supporting hundreds of pounds of vertical load, remember them?). 2004 was simpler times for the bike industry, and Shimano wasn’t ready to tell all the frame manufacturers to redesign all of their frames (don’t worry, we’ll get there later). Shimano decided to solve the problem by thinking outside of the bottom bracket shell, <a href="https://ibb.co/bPtypd" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">literally</a>. They moved the bearings from inside the BB shell to outside, so they could keep the bearings the same size (the smaller they try to make them, the less reliable they will get), while fitting the larger spindle in the same BB shell.  This is called ‘Outboard Bearings’ and became a mainstay of threaded bottom brackets. This bumps out the total width of the BB to 86mm (68mm shell plus 9mm of outboard bearings on each side). SRAM followed along with a standard called GXP, which also has a 24mm spindle (which necks down to 22mm at the left side, but is basically the same principle as Hollowtech II). It could be removed and installed with the external splines around the outboard bearing cups, just like square taper.</p><p>Many historians consider this era to be the high water mark of human civilization. Threaded bottom brackets are great, Hollowtech II cranks are great, you can install the whole shebang in 5 minutes using a $20 splined wrench. This is undoubtedly the golden age of bottom brackets.</p><p><strong>Behold the inevitable creaking of progress: BB30</strong></p><p>The frame manufacturers (which Shimano had appeased, by making Hollowtech II outboard bearing bottom brackets that work perfectly with every single frame) decided to strike back. When frames were mostly metal, a threaded BB was easy – you’d get the right diameter metal BB shell, weld or braze your other tubes to it, then cut some threads on the inside and you’re golden. With carbon frames, things got tricky. You’d need to bond a metal insert to the carbon, then cut threads in it. Thus, frame manufacturers developed the idea of a ‘Press Fit’ bottom bracket. To make things ‘lighter and stiffer’ in bike industry parlance (English translation: cheaper to mass produce) , they said “Hey, instead of a bonded metal insert in the frame that you thread the bearing cups into, why don’t you just press the bearing cups directly into the frame”.</p><p>The first and foremost of these Press Fit barbarian tribes attempting to sack our city of Rome (English Threaded + Hollowtech II) was Cannondale, with their <a href="https://ibb.co/ftzGaJ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">BB30</a>. BB30 says “Hey, if Shimano replaced a &lt;20mm solid steel spindle with a 24mm hollow steel spindle to make things lighter and stiffer, why don’t we turn it up to eleven and use a 30mm hollow aluminum spindle to take the lightness and stiffness to the max?”. Well, that’s what their marketing people said. What really happened was their beancounters said “Hey, it costs us $7 in aluminum and $19 in labor to bond aluminum inserts in the frame and thread them, but it will only cost us $3 in carbon to make the BB shell wider and form bearing cups, find a way to sell that to the customers”.</p><p>Now, remember, our 68mm wide, 34mm internal diameter BB shell was originally designed for a narrow steel spindle, and now we have this huge 30mm spindle. Again, our options are to increase the width or increase the diameter, because otherwise there’s no room for bearings. Cannondale decides to increase the diameter – that’s pretty easy for them. So they increase the  internal diameter of the shell from 34mm to 42mm, while keeping it 68mm wide. Our bearings can come back inboard, we still have a narrow Q-factor (not that anyone was complaining about the 86mm threaded Hollowtech II).</p><p>On the topic of BB30, I should mention that there are some runty little offspring of it as well. PF30 uses a 46mm diameter shell, then they press in bearing cups that have an inside diameter of 42mm. So it’s the same bearings and spindle as BB30, it’s just that there are additional plastic cups between the bearings and the frame. There’s also BB30A, which is 5mm wider but only on the non drive side – so it’s 73mm rather than 68mm, but all that extra 5mm comes on the non-drive side. The cranks aren’t necessarily interchangeable because there are varieties of different spindle lengths, and you need a long enough spindle to take up that extra 5mm. Cervelo’s BBright used a similar idea to BB30A, except 11mm extra on the non-drive side rather than 5mm. And there’s Specialized OSBB, which is very similar to BB30.</p><p>Now, obviously Shimano was none too happy about this, because these OEMs started spec’ing 30mm spindle cranksets, which are made by companies that aren’t Shimano – Cannondale has their in-house cranks, Specialized uses a lot of Praxis cranks, and SRAM offers most of their cranks with a 30mm spindle option. It is possible to use a 24mm spindle in a BB30, which requires <a href="https://ibb.co/foaB9d" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">adapters</a>. The 24mm spindle is longer and narrower than a 30mm spindle, so you can just use cheap plastic spacers that sit inside the bearings and take out that extra 6mm of diameter.</p><p><strong>Hollowtech II Strikes Back: BB86</strong></p><p>Somebody (I don’t know who) said “Why don’t we just take an English Threaded Hollowtech II and make a press-fit version?” and they did, and thus was born <a href="https://ibb.co/k3ANFJ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">BB86</a>. Remember, our old threaded HT2 was a 68mm wide shell, but it had 9mm outboard bearings, making it 86mm wide. BB86 makes the frame shell itself 86mm wide, and increases the diameter a bit so our formerly outboard bearings are now inboard. This also let the frame manufacturers tout increased stiffness, because the extra width of the BB shell means that the whole area could be beefed up (remember, BB30 has a stiffer crank because of the increased diameter spindle, BB86 has a stiffer frame because of the wider BB shell).</p><p><strong>Attempt at armistice fails: BB386EVO</strong></p><p>After a couple years of these two competing families of bottom brackets, FSA said “Why can’t we all be friends?” and introduced <a href="https://ibb.co/nPbJpd" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">BB386EVO</a>. The idea of BB386EVO is to take the larger shell diameter of the BB30 system (which was the same width as threaded), and the wider shell of the BB86 system (which is the same diameter as threaded), and combine them. The idea is that you can get the benefits of a lighter, stiffer 30mm spindle, while also getting the frame stiffness from the wider shell. Just about any crank will work in a BB386EVO frame. Since this is clearly the best standard with the most compatibility, frame manufacturers were quick to adopt it, and it’s now the industry standard. Psyche! I almost had you, didn’t I? A couple of OEMs jumped on board with it, but for the most part the big manufacturers stuck with what they were already doing (or came up with more dumb crap like BB30A). Oh, and just a few weeks ago SRAM announced that they are consolidating their BB30 30mm and GXP 24/2mm product lines into a single ‘DUB’ 28.99mm spindle product line, for reasons unbeknownst to us mere mortals.</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous notes</strong></p><p>I should also take a moment to mention that there is growing aftermarket support for conversion bottom brackets from Wheels Manufacturing, Praxis, and others. For instance, they offer bottom brackets that thread together and are less prone to creaks than press-fit. Or they offer a BB30 bottom bracket that actually has the correct size bearings for a 24mm spindle, so you don’t have to use plastic cups in a BB30 bottom bracket if you want to run a 24mm crank.  There are also some options aimed at fitting 30mm spindles in smaller bottom brackets, but those can be less durable, since they rely on reducing the bearing sizes (sometimes doubling up bearings). I should also add that in many instances there are some MTB-unique variants that are a bit wider (the issue I mentioned before with wider tires requiring more space between the chainstays) – a MTB threaded BB is often 73mm rather than 68mm, and there is BB92 which is a wider version of BB86.</p></div></div>
