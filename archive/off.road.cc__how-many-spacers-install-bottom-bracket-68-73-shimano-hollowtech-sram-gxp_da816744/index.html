<p><strong>When installing a new or replacement threaded external bottom bracket onto your bike, it&#39;s important to get the right number of spacers on either side</strong><strong>. Whether you&#39;re running a SRAM GXP, SRAM DUB, Shimano Hollowtech II or any similar design, read on to find out how many spacers you should run.</strong></p>

<p><em>[Updated 13th January 2020 with SRAM DUB]</em></p>

<p>The first thing you&#39;ll need to do is to measure your bottom bracket shell of your frame. As in the picture below, the best way to do this is with a set of vernier callipers, but you can also use a steel ruler or tape measure. Obviously, the old bottom bracket will need to be removed to do this and you should measure from the edge to edge, so if you&#39;re not using callipers, stick your ruler inside the shell so that any chain guide mounts or similar don&#39;t skew the measurement.</p>

</p></div>

<p>You should now know how wide your bottom bracket shell is. For a threaded bottom bracket, there are only three common sizes; 68mm, 73mm and 83mm. If your bottom bracket shell measurement isn&#39;t very close to one of those, you&#39;ve probably measured it incorrectly - or something very odd is going on with your frame.</p>

<p>The shell width determines how many spacers you need on each side, but it also depends on which brand you&#39;re using. </p>

<h2>For 68mm and 83mm Shimano HTII bottom brackets</h2>

<div><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" alt="How-many-BB-spacers-do-I-need-102.jpg" data-src="https://off.road.cc/sites/default/files/styles/640px/public/thumbnails/image/How-many-BB-spacers-do-I-need-102.jpg?itok=wFg6JYpq" loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://off.road.cc/sites/default/files/styles/640px/public/thumbnails/image/How-many-BB-spacers-do-I-need-102.jpg?itok=wFg6JYpq"/>
</p></div>

<p>A 68mm or 83mm bottom bracket shell needs two of the 2.5mm spacers on the drive (chainring) side and one 2.5mm spacer on the non-drive side. </p>

<h2>For 73mm Shimano HTII bottom brackets</h2>

<div><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" alt="How-many-BB-spacers-do-I-need-103.jpg" data-src="https://off.road.cc/sites/default/files/styles/640px/public/thumbnails/image/How-many-BB-spacers-do-I-need-103.jpg?itok=xPVEDJIK" loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://off.road.cc/sites/default/files/styles/640px/public/thumbnails/image/How-many-BB-spacers-do-I-need-103.jpg?itok=xPVEDJIK"/>
</p></div>

<p>If your bottom bracket shell is 73mm wide, you only need one 2.5mm spacer fitted to the drive side.</p>

<p>If you need to use a bottom bracket mounted chain guide or derailleur, then you&#39;ll also need to remove the innermost 2.5mm spacer on the drive side - so a 68mm or 83mm shell will have one drive side spacer and one non-drive side spacer, while a 73mm shell will need no spacers at all.</p>
        
        
        
        

<h2>For SRAM GXP 73mm bottom brackets</h2>

<p>You don&#39;t need to install any spacers onto the bottom bracket if you have a 73mm shell.</p>

<h2>For SRAM GXP 68mm bottom brackets</h2>

<p>You&#39;ll need to use both the provided 2.5mm spacers for a 68mm shell, placing one on either side of the bottom bracket.</p>

<h2>For SRAM DUB 73mm bottom brackets</h2>

<p>Much like GXP, you don&#39;t need to add any spacers to the bottom bracket if you have a 73mm shell, but you will need to add a 4.5mm spacer to the right-hand side of the crank axle, unless you&#39;re using a chain guide, in which case a 2mm spacer is required instead, along with a 2.5mm spacer on the right-hand side of the bottom bracket.</p>

<p>If your bike has Super Boost hub spacing (157x12mm) and a 73mm shell then you&#39;ll need a 4.5mm spacer on the left-hand side of the crank axle, a 9mm spacer on the right-hand side of the crank axle and no spacers on the bottom bracket.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re running a chain device with your Super Boost setup then you&#39;ll need a 2.5mm spacer on the right-hand side of the bottom bracket and a 4.5mm spacer on left-hand side of the crank axle and a 6.5mm spacer on the right.</p>

<h2>For SRAM DUB 68mm bottom brackets</h2>

<p>Once again, DUB 68mm is just like GXP, with a 2.5mm spacer needed on either side of the bottom bracket shell. You&#39;ll also need a 4.5mm spacer on the right-hand side of the crank axle.</p>

<p>Easy eh?</p>
