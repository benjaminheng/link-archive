He (she? not sure) calls the A minor and C major scales the same, because they contain the same notes. That&#39;s not an odd thought, but it&#39;s like calling sine and cosine the same because both functions contain the same set of values, in the same order.<p>The difference is phase. Basically, scales aren&#39;t just an ordered set of notes, they also have a <i>starting point</i>. This note, the note the scale is named after, is often the last note of a tune played in that scale, and often the first too (especially for more poppy tunes). So if you play Für Elise in C major, like Eevee suggests, the entire melody will be pitched 3 semitones <i>higher</i> than playing Für Elise in A major. And it&#39;ll sound awkward because you&#39;re supposed to play it on a minor scale.</p><p>Once you understand this, the whole notation thing makes a lot more sense as well.

This is simply the notes implied by the key signature, and so is identical (but down a third) from the relative major. If you play purely in the natural minor, you are really closer to the Aeolian mode than a minor key.</p><p>There is also the &#34;harmonic minor&#34; and &#34;melodic minor&#34; which, in common practice period, are much more commonly used than natural minor.  Harmonic minor has a raised seventh.  This makes the dominant (V) triad a major triad which increases its need to resolve to the tonic (I).  It is used for harmonies (obviously based on the name) for this reason, but it makes the step from 6 to 7 an augmented second (i.e. minor third) so its isn&#39;t used melodically very often.  Which is why there is also a Melodic Minor.</p><p>Melodic minor is tricky because it varies depending on whether the melody is ascending or descending.  Descending is easy, it is identical to natural minor.  Ascending is similar to the harmonic minor with its raised seventh (creating what is known as a leading tone, i.e. a half step below the tonic that wants to resolve up to the tonic.)  But the ascending scale also has a raised sixth, which eliminates the augmented second between 6 and 7.

The extreme example is a melody that consists of only a single note. Ridiculous, but as a fellow nerd I&#39;m sure you can see how I could call a single note a melody. So we have to lose the phase metaphor here a little bit.</p><p><i>Most</i> songs &#34;anchor&#34; with the last note. If you really can&#39;t tell whether a song is in major or minor (songs in major are a bit happier, jollier; songs in minor a bit sadder and more melancholic), going for the very last note (or the last note of the chorus, if the song a chorus) is a very good bet. Find the core melody of the song, the thing everything is hung up on, the last note of that core melody is the ground note of the scale. This is a <i>really</i> safe bet.</p><p>There are, of course, exceptions, and then I think you&#39;ll need to do some mathematical analysis to find out which key the notes in the melody match the best to. I&#39;m not 100% sure how this is defined but I&#39;m sure people have researched it.</p><p>All that said, musicians don&#39;t really have this problem. After all, hardly any of this stuff was <i>designed</i>. The only genius piece of engineering in all this was the discovery that if you choose to 12 notes in an octave (and not 8 or 15 or whatever), you have a <i>very</i> versatile instrument that can play almost any melody at any pitch in a way that sounds pretty good to human ears (<i>pretty</i> good, not perfect, because of the all the ≈&#39;s in the &#34;Intervals&#34; section of Eevee&#39;s article).</p><p>But the rest was discovered, not designed, just by fooling around. The analysis came after the music.</p><p>Musicians just start with a scale and then make the music they compose fit. This comes pretty natural to you with a bit of practice; most people have a pretty decent innate ability to hear which melodies &#34;match&#34; with a chord and which chords &#34;match&#34; with a previous chord. In all honesty, once you&#39;ve understood things this far, I&#39;d recommend fooling around with the easiest instrument or tool you know, rather than diving even deeper in to the mathematics of things :-)

To determine a key, you really need at least 2 intervals, wherein interval a somehow resolves to interval b. Keys are just a mapping of relationships; how does each of the 12 notes relate to each other? If you just play a C major chord, you aren&#39;t really playing in the key of CMaj, you&#39;re just playing a CMaj chord.</p><p>For example:
Play B+G, then C+G. This is (arguably) C major. The B note resolves into the C note. That&#39;s the 7th moving into the Tonic (#1). This is an example of a V-I resolution, the strongest possible. If you&#39;d like more examples, look up &#34;cadences&#34;. There are &#39;principles&#39; for determining the key, but they should not be understood as proofs.</p><p>I think you&#39;re also asking if/how to change keys. This is not only possible, but often highly encouraged. There are two extremely common key changes in pop music:
1) Up one step: This is incredibly common and can be heard in &#34;I Will Always Love You&#34; (album version, right after the 3 minute mark when she starts singing the chorus again). Once you start hearing this, you can&#39;t stop. It&#39;s all over the place. If we&#39;re in the key of C, we&#39;ll just play a D chord with a lot of confidence, typically after a G chord.
2) Minor to Major (or reverse, moving from sine to cosine in the analogy): This is much more subtle than the previous example. Typically you&#39;ll recognize this as a change in &#39;mood&#39; or &#39;feeling&#39;. You&#39;ll find a lot of Am-Em changes, then the chorus will be a lot of C-G changes. The tonic changes from Am to C, even though all the chords and notes being used are still the same (although the duration of said chords will probably be different).</p><p>Most &#34;classical&#34; music moves around keys pretty frequently, in extreme cases multiple times within a measure. And then there are chords/sections in which the key is debatable if not indiscernible (I would argue that the intro to Smashing Pumpkins &#34;1979&#34; is changing keys every 2 measures, but I think there&#39;s also a strong argument for it being in a single key)</p><p>Thinking about keys in terms of phases is a good basic explanation, but ultimately phase is much easier to measure. Perhaps I see it this way because my understanding of music is much better than my understanding of physics.

For example, I see the notes C, E, and G on some sheet music, maybe with some accidentals on some of those notes.  I know that I&#39;m therefore supposed to play a C triad.  Now, there are multiple kinds of triads, but once I know I&#39;m supposed to play a triad, it&#39;s easy to use context to pick out which one I need (major, minor, diminished, augmented -- usually one of the first two).  If I were supposed to play a C# major triad, though, and the written notes were (C#-F-G#) as opposed to what they should be (C#-E#-G#) then that&#39;s confusing because it looks like I should be playing an arpeggiated sus4 of some kind.  So the written nature of scales on the staff engenders an understanding of the relationship between the notes.  Basically we write things the way we do so that the people reading the music can more efficiently pattern-match.</p><p>&gt; C major is identical to A minor, and I don’t understand why we need both.</p><p>They&#39;re not identical.  C major and A minor have the same <i>notes</i> in their respective scales.  But we say that a piece is in the <i>key</i> of C major when it resolves to the a C major chord at the end, and we say a piece is in the key of A minor when it resolves to an A minor chord at the end -- an important concept for reasoning about how a piece is supposed to be performed.</p><p>&gt; C minor:    C       D   D#      F       G   G#      A#      C</p><p>Eb, Ab, and Bb, not D#, G#, and A#.</p><p>&gt; This has got to be some of the worst jargon and notation for anything, ever.</p><p>It&#39;s really not.  Keep practicing.  It makes sense, I promise.</p><p>I hear a lot of people -- usually people who have not been studying music for very long -- insist that the system would be more logical if there were no accidentals and there were 12 notes with distinct names and the staff had a bunch more lines on it.  I&#39;ve never bought it.  The notation of music isn&#39;t arbitrary, it&#39;s informed by experience and it <i>works</i>.

You could teach someone to play an instrument the old-fashioned way, person-to-person without any sheets, and once they understood music (i.e. what patterns of notes sound good or don&#39;t) ask them to come up with a way to write it down, and they&#39;d come up with something much like staff notation. But that&#39;s a very labour-intensive way to learn.<p>Hunt-and-peck is always going to be hard on an instrument that supports multiple modes, because each mode only uses some of the modes. At my school music classes were taught on the xylophone/glockenspiel, which you configure for your piece at the start (putting the correct bars on for the mode/key you&#39;re working in), which is probably easier for beginners, but it&#39;s not a popular instrument (and nor is the harp, which is the only other example I can think of of that approach).

A majority of acoustic instruments are monophonic(voice, wind, brass, many strings) and have some form of linearity in pitch, and the staff accommodates them optimally - the beginner&#39;s sheet music always starts out by accompanying the staff with fingerings for each note, to help you get some confidence that you are actually playing right notes, and then after that it&#39;s pretty straightforward to extend your knowlege to read more notes.<p>Chord structure just isn&#39;t even touched in most of these instruments, at least in classical performance, because they aren&#39;t capable of polyphony! That only becomes a topic as one starts moving into, e.g., jazz improvisation, where knowing how to recognize and play around a root is critical. Piano is exceptional here, since finger independence and chording practically define that instrument.</p><p>On the other hand, guitar tabs are a Big Thing in part because guitar chords transpose very well, so you don&#39;t have to learn too many unique fingerings to start accessing the others - and then if the song is defined as a sung melody plus rhythmic chord backing, as a lot of popular songs are, you don&#39;t need more than a tab and hearing the tune once to have a shot at covering it competently.</p><p>Guitar&#39;s 2D layout favors isomorphism - this is what gives it this extra power to transpose. Guitar is conventionally not tuned isomorphically, but some forms of accordion like bayan, and alternative keyboard layouts such as Wicki-Hayden, Harmonic Table or Janko, are fully isomorphic. In that case, you don&#39;t have to mode set or learn any unique scales or chord fingering per key: Learn any set of intervals(chords or scales) and you can reuse them in every key by moving your fingers over. This is wonderful for learning theory and doing composition, but it doesn&#39;t make the instruments a 1-to-1 replacement for similar instruments as in performance the distances are usually much smaller, fingerings can get tangled, it can be harder to find your place or maintain tempo, etc.

That is: learn the seven modes of Western music (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)</a>).<p>Each mode is a diatonic scale (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale</a>). Each mode has a particular combination of whole steps and half steps. Each mode has a &#34;natural&#34; key which can be represented in modern staff notation by all white keys.</p><p>In Gregorian chant, there are <i>rarely</i> any accidentals. Even by the Baroque era, while there are more accidentals, I would say the music is still very diatonic in nature.</p><p>Early music was more oriented towards just intonation (the whole integer ratio harmony mentioned in the article, which is what I would consider the more &#34;natural&#34; way of harmony). With just intonation, however, you can&#39;t just shift to any random key on the fly. Some keys sound nice and related. Some keys sound awful and horrible.</p><p>The article author made a statement: &#34;If your music mostly relies on the seven notes from a particular scale, then it’s more compact to only have room for seven notes in your sheet music, and adjust the meaning of those notes when necessary… right?&#34; I think that&#39;s an absolutely a correct way of framing early Western classical music, yes.</p><p>What makes staff notation harder probably is the corresponding rise in chromatic music.</p><p>The rise of 12TET instruments (equal temperament) like the piano, and the corresponding development of chromatic instruments (compare: the natural horn used in the Baroque era vs. the modern valved horn) allows for this sort of modulation at the cost of some chords being slightly out of tune. Modulating key signature all over the place is now possible. Yes, the author should realize that some composers <i>do</i> change the key in the middle of a song to change the mood. (For a nice pop example, here&#39;s the Temptations&#39; &#34;My Girl&#34;, which changes keys midway through -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IUG-9jZD-g" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IUG-9jZD-g</a>)</p><p>Incidentally, the diatonic nature of pre-19th century classical music is the answer to the author&#39;s sharp / flat question as well. (<a href="http://jtauber.com/blog/2006/11/17/why_a-sharp_is_not_b-flat/" rel="nofollow">http://jtauber.com/blog/2006/11/17/why_a-sharp_is_not_b-flat...</a>)</p><p>This shift to chromaticism really isn&#39;t reflected in staff notation. In fact, I&#39;m aware that some 20th century composers abandoned the use of key notation, ledger lines, etc. altogether, perhaps in part for this sort of reason.

He gives an example of an A# major scale and it becomes immediately obvious that something&#39;s wrong. In order to write such a scale you either have to skip named notes (A#, C, D.. what happened to B?) or have a key signature that contains double sharps. That would be the &#34;theoretically correct&#34; way to do it but there are no key signatures with double sharps. So the correct name for the scale is B flat, which follows the diatonic major scale pattern of &#34;wwhwwwh&#34; and does not skip named notes.<p>But from his point of view (as any beginner) this is very confusing. They sound the same and they use the same physical keys on the keyboard, so what&#39;s the difference? There is no good answer to that except it satisfies the theory (the musical &#34;rules&#34;) of western music.

In the case of a common minor progression: B-E7alt-Am7 the major third of the dominant chord is the same note as the major 7 in the harmonic minor scale of the target minor chord, which would be one option for playing straight through that progression, but you&#39;ll often find that players will use either A harmonic minor, diminished, E altered, G# whole tone, etc. over the V7 and resolve to dorian or aeolian or something with a b7. It doesn&#39;t make much sense to analyze that progression in a classical context since those chords aren&#39;t entirely contained within any single key, and you end up something that looks like a key change, or has B as a secondary dominant implying a key change to the E7, where a jazz player would immediately recognize it as a minor 2-5-1</span></p></div></td></tr>

It is, for example, the basis of oom-pah music (think military marches which repeat C-G in the bass with a melody on top, and end on C when the melody is done).</p><p>There is a form of musical analysis (Schenkerian) that can be used to show that nearly all music has the basic form C-G-C, which is usually expressed as I-V-I (chord I is C major and chord V is the 5th chord of C major, which is G major). It is of course nowhere near as simple as I&#39;ve expressed here!</p><p>So resolution is basically the cadence of the piece&#39;s harmony, much like a story has beginning, middle and end, so does harmony.</p><p>The reason chord V and chord I are so powerfully related is that the 3rd note of V is the leading note of chord I and the 7th note of V is the 4th of chord I. This is actually significant to understand because it is how one can see the purest relationship between harmony and melody. In early music (eg medieval plainsong) the fundamentals of more complex harmony were first developed from melody.</p><p>In the case of C major with two voices, the notes would provide resolution from notes F and B to notes E and C. The FB is a tritone, which is dissonant and wants to be resolved in the human ear. The EC is the major triad of C major, which is harmonious and consonant and resolves the dissonance of FB.

Suddenly, almost all of the clutter was removed, and the problem became manageable.<p>Let&#39;s consider the three-note tune “do, re, mi”. If that tune were played in the key of C, it would become C-D-E. If it were played in G, it would become G-A-B. But in either case, it&#39;s the same tune but with each frequency increased by the same percentage.</p><p>Trying to understand music by understanding the letters is like trying to read in a world where every article has been enciphered into a different “key”: e.g., the word &#34;cab&#34; in “the key of A” (the alphabet we normally use) would be written as &#34;dbc&#34; if the article were written in “the key of B”. In the latter case, you could discern meaning only once you realised that the letter “d” represented the third letter of the alphabet. There&#39;s nothing meaningful about a “d” but there is something meaningful about a “4th letter of the alphabet”.</p><p>Once you start to “decipher” all music into I, II, III, IV, V, etc., the complexity becomes manageable. You can start to learn to recognize the sound of a III note, or of a VI minor chord. After all, there are only eight notes in the major scale.

I was taught music in the UK where that is specifically not used (or at least wasn&#39;t when I learnt).<p>I took a year out of my Music degree to attend the Sorbonne. French music education places a heavy emphasis on solfege. When I started going to their undergraduate classes it was immediately apparent that the level was several years behind that of the UK (in classes for composition and orchestration most noticeably). To attend classes dealing with similar material to what I was used to as a UK undergraduate, I was attending Post-grad courses. Having just completed my first year on a UK BMus course it was quite an eye opener to see 19yr olds learning material I had been taught at 16.

Most people have perfect relative pitch (afaik I fall into this group). Perfect absolute pitch and tone-deafness are both quite rare.</p><p>It sounds like the French system is optimised for the majority, forcing everyone to practise interval differentiation, including those who don&#39;t need it (and the small minority who will never be able to do it).

That&#39;s a sieving process for sure.<p>When they get to secondary school, music as a subject is most often just a minor inconvenience in the curriculum to most pupils, and those who have ability are pushed into learning flute/violin etc (at additional cost to themselves and outside of the timetable). In the course of going through the grades of music (performance exams), kids are taught aural skills and theory (grade 5 theory is required to take higher performance grades). This results in a select group of instrumentalists that have learned intervals, harmony and scales practically. Whether any of those skills are useful to a non musician is debatable, so one could say that it is the most efficient way of getting a rounded skill set into the brain of a musical 15-16 yr old.</p><p>The French system would, I agree, produce a broader spectrum of musically able people, but in practice it results in a lower level of specific and important knowledge. The UK system produces more complete performers whereas I would say the French system has large gaps which then get filled in at degree level.</p><p>Perhaps things are greatly different these days. I know for example that studio production is an option for A level music, and there is absolutely no musical theory knowledge required to produce a studio track. I wonder if A level students are even taught basic 4 part harmony any more.</p><p>Music, to an individual, has always been a matter of ability, discipline and perseverance to practice. In education, the solution to nourishing those qualities is never going to be perfect. I do recall the French students I was with were quite annoyed that my education was years ahead of theirs, but with perspective, I&#39;m sure it didn&#39;t really matter then, and it surely doesn&#39;t now.

Let&#39;s take the specific musical skill of composition, which I believe is at the root of musical traditions in any country...<p>The French have a much richer and deeper musical tradition. For example the &#39;blood lines&#39; of Renaissance Troubadours and Trouveres, or the French Operatic Style, to name a couple. English &#39;classical&#39; music tradition had a golden age which had Tallis, Byrd and Dowland but kinda stopped with Purcell and didn&#39;t really flourish again until Elgar. Elgar himself was writing in an identifiably English way, but his language was very much based on the Germanic tradition (which been imprinted on the English style by the likes of Handel,Haydn,Schumann and Mendelssohn).</p><p>All that time, let&#39;s say broadly 1700-1900 the French were much closer to their own &#39;cutting edge&#39; of musical development, although the Germanic style was still very much dominant throughout Europe. What the French had, was a progressive heritage that had somehow been preserved - Ravel and Debussy (the impressionist style) could only have come from France, which I think would relate to your reference to a broader musical culture.</p><p>Of course by the mid 20th Century, in Classical music at least, the French started leaping ahead of the UK again, with Stravinsky, Les Six, Satie and numerous others building a significant new tradition that still exists today through the legacies of Messiaen and Boulez. England had Britten, Vaughn Williams and few others of note.</p><p>I think the reason you see a broader base in French &#39;national&#39; music (for example at la fete) is as much down to the fact that England produced and still does produce exemplary pop/rock with a worldwide market. The French pop culture is insular and that&#39;s a good thing IMHO because it maintains integrity and does not to attempt to compete in a global market that is pretty much a cultural vacuum these days.</p><p>As for the standard of professional performers, I think there isn&#39;t too much difference in numbers produced or quality. Being a pro musician is very hard and the attrition rates are not down to which country you make your career in.

                  <p><span>It looks better on paper for an engineer, but not for someone who actually plays an instrument and reads the notation. With most western music, not all 12 pitches in an octave are used most of the time, but only a subset determined by the key and scale. Although the currently used notation may look weird for a newbie, it takes just a quick look at the key signature and you know which pitches will be used in a piece of music. When you know the scale (and practicing scales is just a standard part of learning), then  &#34;decoding&#34; a note by counting tones is much easier than counting individual semitones (12 seems just too many). After a little practice you get it intuitively and you really don&#39;t count; you just know where each tone (or chord) is in a given scale and what function it has. And then when you suddenly see an additional flat or sharp symbol before a note, you know that this is an out-of-scale note, so it is also easier to play it.

A musician plays music in a scale, they aren&#39;t a computer outputting pitches, they are a person playing notes. Music notation has a reason to be this way: notes in the scale don&#39;t have flats or sharps next to them, accidentals do. Reducing everything to a number describing absolute pitches is the right thing to do for a computer to play (see midi). It&#39;s not the way to go for a person that actually has to understand the logic and patterns in the music.

It&#39;s two different maps keying to the same set of frequencies. The BASE12 system described above would allow for keys as well, just with a different notation. Instead of flats/sharps marked next to the clef in traditional sheet music, the BASE12 system could start each line with a list of &#39;prohibited&#39; notes. For example, when indicating that a piece is in the key of Gm, the staff in BASE12 could start with : [01,04,06,08,0b]. This indicates that the majority of the song will be made of the notes 7,9,b,0,2,3, and 5, and serves the same purpose as having two flats next to the treble clef, one on the middle line and one in the top space. Which of these systems would be easier for humans to grok is up for debate. I personally don&#39;t think either one is better.<p>Thinking about it, the traditional notation is just mapping to an octal system, with the key accidentals acting as modifiers to the map and the base-8 values being displayed graphically as vertical position on the staff.

This is not the case for music notation, even for very experienced musicians. The clue is that they associate notes not with sounds or intervals, but with absolute positions (fingerings, etc.) on their instrument. Maybe they can sight-read a melody with a little effort, but for most of them it will be much simpler to just play it - and this goes triple if it&#39;s not tonal and idiomatic for a style you know. Music notation is really a somewhat instrument-independent tabulature.</p><p>Solfege or numeric notation systems, which exist in many versions, are much better for reading in your head once you learn them.

But for instrumentalists, usually your instrument is already biased to certain keys, and going from notation-&gt;sound in your head-&gt;fingers would therefore be much harder than going straight from notation-&gt;fingers.

Every musician I know who can sight-read fluently, learned it as a kid.<p>So it&#39;s virtually impossible to try out a new notation system.</p><p>But my impression is that this would be phenomenally hard to read, especially in a live performance situation where your attention is divided between the sheet music and other stuff. If I were staring at a solid grid of text, and were to glance away for a split second, I&#39;d be lost. Part of sight-reading for me is being able to read ahead by a few notes or even a few bars.</p><p>It may also be that conventional notation displays a lot more density on a single page, because a 16th note takes up no more space than a whole note.

Thus, this explanation will probably apply mostly to single-voice musicians.<p>1. Find Do. This is the first note of the Major scale in the key which you are playing. Find it on the page, and burn it into your mind; everything you&#39;re about to do centers on the location of Do. In the key of C (white keys on a piano) Do is right in the middle of the grand staves, keeping things simple. If you know where Do is, you don&#39;t have to care about the key signature for like 97% of the notes you&#39;re going to read, and you can make educated guesses about what the sharps and flats do by using your musical intuition. Once you&#39;ve found Do on the page, figure out where Do is musically, and keep it in your head. Make sure that when you&#39;re singing or playing any other note, you know where you are relative to Do, and can jump back there without losing your place.</p><p>2. Learn your intervals, and learn Solfege. If you&#39;re a musician, you already know these things in principal, even if you don&#39;t know the words or the terminology. In particular, you should be able to &#34;hear&#34; the distance between Do-Mi-Sol without too much difficulty, because you hear those distances in music a lot.</p><p>3. When you&#39;re sight reading the first note in a passage, find the note, then step it off visually to the nearest Do. If you&#39;re good, you can also step it off to the nearest Sol. I usually root myself on Do and Sol both in a given passage, as it gives me less visual separation between any note I need to find in a hurry.</p><p>4. For every note after that first note, pay mind to the spacing on the page:</p><p>4a. Moving up and down the scale should be easy; you&#39;re a musician, you already know what a scale sounds like, just sing along.</p><p>4b. Moving up or down from one line to the next line is a third. Most often you&#39;ll hear these relative to Do-Mi-So-Ti in major keys, and La-Do-Mi in minor keys. You&#39;ll hear these a <i>lot,</i> so get used to reading them quickly.</p><p>4c. Get a good feel for common jumps while you&#39;re at it. As a Bass singer, I got <i>really</i> good at reading jumps between Do-Fa and Do-So, because those chord progressions exist in everything, and their sole purpose in life is to make bass singers bored out of their mind. You&#39;re a human, in addition to a musician, so you&#39;ll pick up on the patterns in any given composition and have the common tricks down before you even realize what your brain is doing. Don&#39;t question that, let your brain be awesome all on its own.</p><p>That sounds like a lot of steps, until you realize that you&#39;re performing most of them already to make sense of any piece of music that you play. Don&#39;t worry about the names or the terminology, you can use numbers (1-3-5) if that&#39;s easier, or just &#34;hear&#34; it if you don&#39;t feel like you need an aide. Remember, the goal is to drop the aide and be able to just perform these steps on your own eventually.</p><p>I&#39;m analytical in nature, so I&#39;m always thinking about these things. I suspect the reason most musicians can&#39;t describe this process very well is because the process of analyzing our craft detracts from the quality of its output. The more you can commit to &#34;muscle memory&#34; as a musician, the more you can pull your analytical mind out of the process of a performance, the easier it becomes. Your body&#39;s built in reflexes are faster than your analytical brain will ever be, and good musicians tap into that biological strength through loads of practice.

Our songbooks used a variation on music notation that used shape notes, and the shapes corresponded to Solfege. If you knew your musical intervals, you could completley ignore the key signature, because a Do was always drawn as a triangle, a Sol was a circle, a La was a square, etc etc. This was especially handy because the song leaders were always men, and could not always sing as high as the written music required. They picked whatever key they could sing comfortably, and the congregation adjusted to them. Drove the music majors in the audience nuts. :D</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_note" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_note</a></p><p>Growing up with that system meant that Solfege was simply the easiest system I had to understand music. To this day, I struggle with pieces in unusual modes, and with passages that modulate their key and make use of unusual progressions, because it breaks down my innate understanding of music and requires me to think in a different way.

It took me several months of twice-weekly instruction before I finally figured out that he was using solfège for intervals, I&#39;m embarrassed to say (to my instructor&#39;s frustration and confusion).  I&#39;m wincing even now when I think of it.</p><p>I asked around at the time and was told it was pretty universal to use solfège there.</p><p>I do think using solfège to indicate notes is a much better system for students, since it emphasizes the importance of intervals and keys.

I have always been bugged by saying &#34;flat three&#34; or &#34;minor three&#34; when singing intervals, and it&#39;s hard to make the voice actually make it minor (for me) because of the muscle memory for three being so firmly set.<p>So, I may have to somewhat rethink my dismissal of the solfege, at least for singing intervals.

I don&#39;t read much these days, but I recall it working best (or at least fastest and most accurately) when most of the theory was turned off in my brain and I just let the shape of the notes (their distance from each other) guide me. But, I feel like it&#39;s only in improvising and composition where one would be doing any sort of interval math. But, maybe I&#39;m wrong.</p><p>When are you doing this kind of math? When reading, improvising, playing memorized pieces, or composing?

I&#39;m sure when it was invented there were some people who argued against its use and that one should instead stay with &#34;conventional instruments&#34;, which then did not then include the piano.</p><p>I strongly recommend a talk[1] by Jordan Rudess, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest living keyboard players.</p><p>In this talk, Rudess discusses and vividly demonstrates the greatly expanded possibilities that innovative keyboards bring to the table.</p><p>Novel instruments that somewhat resemble conventional instruments like the keyboard are only the tip of the iceberg of music interface possibility, however.  There are plenty of novel music expression technologies that don&#39;t have even the remotest resemblance to conventional instruments, and allow ways of expression that were hardly imaginable a hundred years ago.  Things like whole body position tracking, which allows you to make music through dance.</p><p>Of course, mature musicians like Rudess who&#39;ve spent their entire lives learning and practicing on traditional instruments will be unlikely to switch to something radically different, as they&#39;ll be starting from ground zero on those instruments.

Why do certain sounds evoke certain emotions?</p><p>Just like text, evoking emotions needs some sort of narrative. A story isn&#39;t a single fact or statement (or a single sound); it&#39;s about how those facts (or sounds) flow or change.</p><p>In music you might hear a brief bit of new melody that foreshadows something big later in the song. A clear rhythm or melody might be repeated to get the listener to follow along only to have it cut short at a key moment to deny the obvious resolution (similar to a melodrama that suddenly reveals a new twist in the plot as a cliffhanger).</p><p>It&#39;s the story you tell that matters, and it takes a skilled composer to put sounds together to make a song emotionally evocative. The song that is mostly a 16 bar loop probably sounds boring (but not always!), while the song that introduces the same 16 bars and then plays with variations of it to create an initial conflict, rising action, and a climax is probably a lot more interesting. An obvious example might be Mozart playing Salieri&#39;s march in <i>Amadeus</i>[1]. It&#39;s not just that he embellished the simple march; Mozart adds a lot of variations that culminate at a comic ending.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5n0pkNpDWY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5n0pkNpDWY</a>

Designing any aesthetic is primarily about how patterns are prioritized, associated to other parts of culture and turned into conventional tropes or motives. As we get new genres of music the pattern languages tend to change. (The idea of music as &#34;universal language&#34; is only true in a basic sense of what things our ears and brains can comprehend and how we would perceive them in an ungrounded state. In the details, cultural differences will definitely matter.)<p>So, music theory &#34;catches up&#34; to the pattern language by associating it to human natural language, but it doesn&#39;t say why. I concur with the &#34;music appreciation&#34; recommendation for learning the whys. When you get deep into analysis of a work, all sorts of angles can be found to correlate &#34;the thing in the work&#34; with &#34;the reason and context of its creation&#34;. For one song, maybe it&#39;s the lyrical content that is important. For another, it&#39;s about rhythm, or dynamics. The artist&#39;s life at that moment, sociopolitical context, and newly available technology are often considered as factors. In a complete work, these elements blend such that it can&#39;t be reduced to a singular &#34;this word or phrase is definitely all this thing is&#34; - analysis highlights parts of an experience that can&#39;t be fully conveyed in a different form, rather than trying to &#34;spoil&#34; or &#34;solve&#34; its mysteries.

If you start from a pitch and go upwards in both octaves and perfect fifths (2:1 and 3:2, the two most fundamental intervals), the perfect fifth sequence will land on 11 distinct tones before (nearly) meeting the octave sequence.  Mathematically, (3/2)^12 ≈ 2^7.</p><p>So 12 semitones works out nicely because you can follow perfect fifths out in any direction as far as you want and never go outside the set of semitones. And most of the small-ratio&#39;d intervals can be represented with pairs of notes inside this set.

In the blog post the major seventh is listed as 17:9, but by this method you get a 16:9. Basically the same thing.</p><p>At this stage, you may notice that the notes are roughly equidistant, except for Mi-Fa and Ti-Do, which are at ~half the distance. This is the first hint of the 12-note scale. We could have stopped earlier in the notemaking process and had a 6-note or a 5-note scale or whatever, but it wouldn&#39;t be so equidistant.</p><p>Now pick each note, and build an octave from it. The new notes created will invariably be very close to existing notes, or very close to the midpoint between existing notes. This gets us the 12 note scale (5 midpoints + 7 notes, the aforementioned half-step notes don&#39;t have midpoints), if you choose a canonical note for each part. The number 12 just happens to be the number where simple harmonic ratios can get you a mostly-equidistant scale.</p><p>At this stage, different music systems do different things.</p><p>One kind of Chinese scale uses a 2:3 ratio and generates ratios involving these numbers that form a 12-note (roughly equidistant) division.</p><p>Indian music does something similar, though it instead generates a 22-note scale, where many of the 12-note scale notes have two forms. It is rare that a given piece of music will use <i>both</i> forms of the same note.</p><p>Western music goes ahead and invents the piano, realizes that the piano is hard to tune/transpose, and settles on the twelfth-root-of-two stuff so that transposing becomes dead easy.

Let’s summarize:<p>The core idea of music made with harmonic sounds is that “notes” with frequencies at small-integer ratios will “harmonize”. Harmonic sounds means something like a vibrating string where the vibrations are integer multiples of some fundamental frequency, because other non-integer-multiple vibrations are damped out by the fixture of the string at two points. Different (non-harmonic) types of sounds often sound better with a different sort of scale, for details see this book <a href="http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/ttss.html" rel="nofollow">http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/ttss.html</a></p><p>* * *</p><p>The “octave”, 2:1, is the simplest whole-number ratio, and makes many of the vibrations in two notes in such frequency ratio align with each-other, to the point that two harmonic sounds exactly an octave apart almost sound like the same sound.</p><p>Other simple ratios like 3:1, 4:3, 5:4, etc. also “harmonize”, with (not quite as) many aligned overtones.</p><p>The core idea of the 12-note musical scale (pretty much regardless of specific tuning) is the approximation:</p><p>3^12 = 531441 ≈ 524288 = 2^19</p><p>3/2 ≈ 2^(7/12) [this is accurate to about 0.1%]</p><p>Or another way to say this: 7/12 of “doubling” on a log scale is very nearly “three-to-two”. Musicians call this ratio a “perfect fifth”.</p><p>In the case of equal temperament, an octave is split into 12 precisely equal steps (on a log scale), each one the 12th root of 2.</p><p>There’s one other nice approximation to take advantage of:</p><p>5^3 = 125 ≈ 128 = 2^7</p><p>5/4 ≈ 2^(4/12) [this approximation is only accurate to about 1%]</p><p>Musicians call this ratio a “major third”.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Even outside music, these approximations can be useful for doing approximate computations.</p><p>If only our society switched from decimal to “duodecimal” numerals, it would be very natural to use logarithms base two, notated with “duodecimal” fractions.</p><p>If you have a number expressed in log base two, and you use duodecimal notation, approximately multiplying or dividing by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ... is very easy using addition/subtraction of easy-to-remember multiples of 2^(1/12).</p><p>Unfortunately our society instead has slide rules and measurement scales (decibels, etc.) which are all built around logarithms base ten, and decimal notation.

Here&#39;s my two cents.<p>First of all, let&#39;s focus on harmony (notes played at the same time) as opposed to melody (notes played one after another). What sounds good in a melody is quite culture-dependent, but there are reasons why harmony is more universal.</p><p>Second, let&#39;s focus on sounds that are produced by something long and narrow. In a guitar, violin, or piano it&#39;s a string, and in a flute it&#39;s a column of air. The physics of vibrations goes so that in such a case the sound is composed of harmonics: sine waves of frequencies f, 2f, 3f, 4f, ... If the shape is different (say, a circular membrane of a drum), then this may not apply.</p><p>Suppose we add a second sound, whose fundamental frequency is, say, 3/2 f. This means that its harmonics are 1.5f, 3f, 4.5f, 6f, 7.5f, 9f, ... Half of these (3f, 6f, ...) coincide with the harmonics of the first sound, so the sounds &#34;reinforce&#34; each other. More generally, if the ratio of the frequencies is p/q for some integers p and q, then there will be overlap in the harmonics. And the smaller p and q are, the more overlap there will be.

My wording is was bit poor.<p>What I should have said that harmony is less ad hoc; it has less &#34;degrees of freedom&#34;.</p><p>With regards to melody, there are tons of tuning systems that are quite close to the usual twelve-tone equal temperament. It would be hard to give a convincing argument that one of these sounds better than all others.</p><p>Contrast this to the system of harmony where the basic principle is that ratios of small integers sound good together. This is not the only possible system of harmony, but it does seem to represent some kind of local optimum. And this makes it more amenable to the kind of purely theoretical reasoning that the article is trying to do.
