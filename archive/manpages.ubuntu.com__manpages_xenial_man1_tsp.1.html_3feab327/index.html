A simple unix batch system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>       <b>tsp</b> <b>[</b><u>actions</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>command...</u><b>]</b>

       Actions:  <b>[-KClhV]</b>  <b>[-t</b>  <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-c</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-p</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-o</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-s</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-r</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-w</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b>
       <b>[-u</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-i</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-U</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>id</u><b>-</b><u>id</u><b>&gt;]</b> <b>[-S</b> <b>[</b><u>num</u><b>]]</b>

       Options: <b>[-nfgmd]</b> <b>[-L</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>label</u><b>&gt;]</b> <b>[-D</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>id</u><b>&gt;]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>       <b>ts</b> will run by default a per user unix task queue. The user can add commands to the queue,
       watch  that  queue  at any moment, and look at the task results (actually, standard output
       and exit error).

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>USE</b></h4><pre>       Calling <b>ts</b> with a command will add that command to  the  queue,  and  calling  it  without
       commands or parameters will show the task list.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>       When  adding  a  job  to ts, we can specify how it will be run and how will the results be
       collected:

       <b>-n</b>     Do not store the standard output/error in a file at <b>$TMPDIR</b> - let it use  the  file
              descriptors  decided  by  the calling process. If it is not used, the <b>jobid</b> for the
              new task will be outputed to stdout.

       <b>-g</b>     Pass the output through gzip (only if <b>-n</b> ). Note that the  output  files  will  not
              have a .gz extension.

       <b>-f</b>     Don  not  put  the task into background. Wait the queue and the command run without
              getting detached of the terminal. The exit code will be that of the command, and if
              used together with -n, no result will be stored in the queue.

       <b>-m</b>     Mail  the  results  of the command (output and exit code) to <b>$TS_MAILTO</b> , or to the
              <b>$USER</b> using <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail.</b>  Look at <b>ENVIRONMENT.</b>

       <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;label&gt;</b>
              Add a label to the task, which will appear next to its  command  when  listing  the
              queue.  It  makes  more  comfortable distinguishing similar commands with different
              goals.

       <b>-d</b>     Run the command only if the command before finished well (errorlevel = 0). This new
              task  enqueued  depends  on  the result of the previous command. If the task is not
              run, it is considered as failed for further dependencies.

       <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>
              Run the command only if the job of given id finished well (errorlevel  =  0).  This
              new task enqueued depends on the result of the previous command. If the task is not
              run, it is considered as failed for further dependencies.  If  the  server  doesn&#39;t
              have the job id in its list, it will be considered as if the job failed.

       <b>-B</b>     In  the  case the queue is full (due to <b>TS_MAXCONN</b> or system limits), by default ts
              will block the enqueuing command. Using <b>-B</b>, if the  queue  is  full  it  will  exit
              returning the value 2 instead of blocking.

       <b>-E</b>     Keep  two  different output files for the command stdout and stderr. stdout goes to
              the file announced by ts (look at <b>-o</b>), and stderr goes to the stdout file  with  an
              additional  &#34;.e&#34;.  For  example, /tmp/ts-out.SKsDw8 and /tmp/ts-out.SKsDw8.e.  Only
              the stdout file gets created with <b>mkstemp</b>,  ensuring  it  does  not  overwrite  any
              other; the &#34;.e&#34; will be overwritten if it existed.

       <b>-N</b> <b>&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Run  the command only if there are num <b>slots</b> <b>free</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>queue.</b> <b>Without</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b>
              <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>slot</b> <b>free.</b> <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>queue</b> <b>to</b>  <b>feed</b>  <b>cpu</b>
              <b>cores,</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>you</b>  <b>know</b>  <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>two</b> <b>cores,</b> <b>with</b> <b>-N</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>let</b> <b>ts</b> <b>know</b>
              <b>that.</b>

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>       Instead of giving a new command, we can use the parameters for other purposes:

       <b>-K</b>     Kill the <b>ts</b> server for the calling client. This will remove the unix socket and all
              the  <b>ts</b> processes related to the queue. This will not kill the command being run at
              that time.

              It is not reliable to think that <b>ts</b> <b>-K</b>  will  finish  when  the  server  is  really
              killed. By now it is a race condition.

       <b>-C</b>     Clear the results of finished jobs from the queue.

       <b>-l</b>     Show  the  list  of jobs - to be run, running and finished - for the current queue.
              This is the default behaviour if <b>ts</b> is called without options.

       <b>-t</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show the last ten lines  of  the  output  file  of  the  named  job,  or  the  last
              running/run  if not specified. If the job is still running, it will keep on showing
              the additional output until the job finishes. On exit, it returns the errorlevel of
              the job, as in <b>-c</b>.

       <b>-c</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Run  the  system&#39;s cat to the output file of the named job, or the last running/run
              if not specified. It will block until all  the  output  can  be  sent  to  standard
              output, and will exit with the job errorlevel as in <b>-c</b>.

       <b>-p</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show the pid of the named job, or the last running/run if not specified.

       <b>-o</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show  the  output  file  name  of  the  named  job,  or the last running/run if not
              specified.

       <b>-s</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show the job state of the named job, or the last in the queue.

       <b>-r</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Remove the named job, or the last in the queue.

       <b>-w</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Wait for the named job, or for the last in the queue.

       <b>-u</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Make the named job (or the last in the queue) urgent -  this  means  that  it  goes
              forward in the queue so it can run as soon as possible.

       <b>-i</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show  information  about  the named job (or the last run). It will show the command
              line, some times related to the task,  and  also  any  information  resulting  from
              <b>TS_ENV</b> (Look at <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>).

       <b>-U</b> <b>&lt;id-id&gt;</b>
              Interchange  the  queue  positions  of the named jobs (separated by a hyphen and no
              spaces).

       <b>-h</b>     Show help on standard output.

       <b>-V</b>     Show the program version.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI-SLOT</b></h4><pre>       <b>ts</b> by default offers a queue where  each  job  runs  only  after  the  previous  finished.
       Nevertheless,  you can change the maximum number of jobs running at once with the <b>-S</b> <b>[num]</b>
       parameter. We call that number the <u>amount</u> <u>of</u> <u>slots</u>. You can also set the initial number of
       jobs  with  the  environment  variable  <b>TS_SLOTS</b>  <b>.</b>   When increasing this setting, queued
       waiting jobs will be run at once until reaching the  maximum  set.  When  decreasing  this
       setting, no other job will be run until it can meet the amount of running jobs set.   When
       using an amount of slots greater than 1, the action of some commands may change a bit. For
       example,  <b>-t</b>  without  <u>jobid</u>  will  tail the first job running, and <b>-d</b> will try to set the
       dependency with the last job added.

       <b>-S</b> <b>[num]</b>
              Set the maximum amount of running jobs at once. If you don&#39;t specify  <b>num</b>  it  will
              return the maximum amount of running jobs set.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>       <b>TS_MAXFINISHED</b>
              Limit  the  number  of job results (finished tasks) you want in the queue. Use this
              option if you are tired of <b>-C.</b>

       <b>TS_MAXCONN</b>
              The maximum number of ts server connections to  clients.  This  will  make  the  ts
              clients block until connections are freed. This helps, for example, on systems with
              a limited number of processes, because each job waiting in the queue remains  as  a
              process. This variable has to be set at server start, and cannot be modified later.

       <b>TS_ONFINISH</b>
              If  the  variable  exists  pointing  to an executable, it will be run by the client
              after the queued job. It uses execlp, so <b>PATH</b> is used if there are  no  slashes  in
              the  variable content. The executable is run with four parameters: <b>jobid</b> <b>errorlevel</b>
              <b>output_filename</b> and <b>command.</b>

       <b>TMPDIR</b> As the program output and the unix socket are thought to be stored in  a  temporary
              directory, <b>TMPDIR</b> will be used if defined, or <b><a href="file:///tmp">/tmp</a></b> otherwise.

       <b>TS_SOCKET</b>
              Each  queue  has  a  related unix socket. You can specify the socket path with this
              environment variable.  This  way,  you  can  have  a  queue  for  your  heavy  disk
              operations,  another  for heavy use of ram., and have a simple script/alias wrapper
              over  ts  for  those  special  queues.  If  it  is  not  specified,  it   will   be
              <b>$TMPDIR/socket-ts.[uid].</b>

       <b>TS_SLOTS</b>
              Set the number of slots at the start of the server, similar to <b>-S,</b> but the contents
              of the variable are read only when running the first instance of <b>ts.</b>

       <b>TS_MAILTO</b>
              Send the letters with job results  to  the  address  specified  in  this  variable.
              Otherwise,  they  are  sent  to  <b>$USER</b>  or  if  not  defined,  <b>nobody.</b>   The system
              <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b> is used. The job outputs are  not  sent  as  an  attachment,  so
              understand the consequences if you use the <b>-gm</b> flags together.

       <b>USER</b>   As seen above, it is used for the mail destination if <b>TS_MAILTO</b> is not specified.

       <b>TS_SAVELIST</b>
              If  it  is  defined  when  starting the queue server (probably the first <b>ts</b> command
              run), on SIGTERM the queue status will  be  saved  to  the  file  pointed  by  this
              environment variable - for example, at system shutdown.

       <b>TS_ENV</b> This  has  a  command  to be run at enqueue time through <b><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?sh">/bin/sh</a></b>. The output of the
              command will be readable through the option <b>-i</b>. You can use a command  which  shows
              relevant   environment   for   the   command   run.    For  example,  you  may  use
              <b>TS_ENV=&#39;pwd;set;mount&#39;</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>       <b>/tmp/ts.error</b>
              if <b>ts</b> finds any internal problem, you should find an error  report  there.   Please
              send this to the author as part of the bug report.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>       <b>ts</b>  expects  a  simple command line. It does not start a shell parser.  If you want to run
       complex shell commands, you may want to  run  them  through  <b>sh</b>  <b>-c</b>  <b>&#39;commands...&#39;</b>   Also,
       remember that stdin/stdout/stderr will be detached, so do not use your shell&#39;s redirection
       operators when you put a job into background.  You can use them inside the <b>sh</b> <b>-c</b> in  order
       to set redirections to the command run.

       If an internal problem is found in runtime, a file <b>/tmp/ts.error</b> is created, which you can
       submit to the developer in order to fix the bug.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>       This page describes <b>ts</b> as in version 0.7.5. Other versions may  differ.  The  file  <b>TRICKS</b>
       found in the distribution package can show some ideas on special uses of <b>ts.</b>

       The Debian version of <b>ts</b> is called <b>tsp</b> to avoid name conflict with moreutils package.
