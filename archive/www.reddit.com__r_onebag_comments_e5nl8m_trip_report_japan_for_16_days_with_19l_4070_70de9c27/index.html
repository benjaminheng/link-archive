<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-click-id="text" data-adclicklocation="media"><p>Trip was awesome.  Everything I brought packed into the bag, except my single pair of shoes (ankle boots) and my coat (which I wore all the time anyway).  I&#39;ve broken down the highlights, but I also included my full packing list below for the diehards.</p><p>Also, the day before I left, I purchased a 25L duffel that packs into its own pocket, and filled that with souvenirs for others (souvenirs were also purchased right before leaving Japan).  This was a great solution to the question of souvenirs/gifts.</p><p>I&#39;m a 6&#39;0&#34; (183 cm) 145 lb (65 kg) female, for reference.</p><p><strong>MVPs:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Tom Bihn Synapse 19 - not cheap, but after a few trips, I am still in love with this pack. (<a href="https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-19?variant=13229969145919" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Anker PowerCore Fusion - charger and power bank in 1, used this multiple times every day (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Foldable/dp/B01K702S66/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=anker+powercore&amp;qid=1575397026&amp;s=books&amp;sr=8-8" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Long Tall Sally Point Zero Ultralight Packable Jacket - Mine is a different color and came with a packing sack that is shaped like a travel pillow, this one is close. (<a href="https://www.longtallsally.com/coats-jackets/point-zero-packable-ultralight-jacket-10AD018/p" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Eagle Creek Packing cubes, particularly the Small (x2), Extra Small (x1), and Mini (x2) sizes.  Two Small cubes and an Extra Small cube fit in the main compartment of the TBS19 with a little room to spare, and the Minis fit in almost every other pocket easily.</p></li><li><p>Cotton hanky - any one will do.  Easy wash, easy dry, perfect if you have a runny nose, less bulky than a packet of tissues.</p></li><li><p>Keyport Small multitool - You&#39;d be surprised how often you need to open something that requires a TSA-approved blade.  This one was super sharp and so useful, even just for the blade.  (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keyport-MOCA-10-Key-Tool/dp/B071J1C9GR/ref=pd_aw_fbt_229_img_3/130-1523686-8173248?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B071J1C9GR&amp;pd_rd_r=f4cc5ba7-6a67-4592-9ff1-5d4b4cd178f9&amp;pd_rd_w=nqO23&amp;pd_rd_wg=ezwl6&amp;pf_rd_p=6e6afc8a-fbbd-4649-97cf-4e08f5113612&amp;pf_rd_r=GX8BRP2BH77W1S3A1JMD&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=GX8BRP2BH77W1S3A1JMD" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Meriwool &#34;Buff&#34; - Our nice weather meant this didn&#39;t get much use for warmth, but it was awesome to keep the sun off my neck and as an eyeshade for sleeping.  Multipurpose! (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N2OTMU4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Intimina Lily Cup - Menstrual cup that folds flat and does its job.  Fabulous.  (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079JSS8LD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Vapur collapsible water bottle - Packs down to almost nothing, and is SO handy when you need it.  I&#39;ve loved mine for travel, and have used one for years. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BKAF73O/ref=twister_B07LCHNH5R?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>BareTraps booties - I picked an ankle boot with the Stay Dry System after trying on probably a dozen boots.  I was determined to bring only one pair of shoes, so it had to be just right.  These were warm and comfortable out of the box, and I used them for hiking, city walking, and an 18 mile bike ride.  Easy on/off with just a zipper (in Japan, you&#39;re taking shoes on and off a lot).</p></li><li><p>Stretch mesh bralette from American Apparel - Great if you don&#39;t need much support.  Packs down to nothing, and it&#39;s fast-drying (<a href="https://www.americanapparel.com/en/stretch-mesh-bralette_psm3655w" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Prana Briann pant - comfortable, fast-drying, five-pocket styling.  I went a size up for the legs, and needed the waist brought in (<a href="https://www.prana.com/p/briann-pant/W43179908.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Contacts cases for toiletries (see below)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Hall of Shame and/or Wouldn&#39;t Pack Again:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gorilla Gadgets Apple Watch Charger - Garbage. Stopped working near the beginning of the trip, so I was forced to buy a new one in Japan (<a href="https://gorillagadgets.com/products/apple-watch-portable-charger" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Here</a>)</p></li><li><p>Travel wet wipes and travel tissues - nothing wrong with them, just literally no need for them in Japan, where you get single wet wipes with every meal/snack.  May have been more useful in a different country.  I never even opened them.</p></li><li><p>Glasses case and extra glasses.  Didn&#39;t need or use them; new glasses aren&#39;t hard to buy in Japan.</p></li><li><p>I packed some zipper pulls, thinking I would use some downtime to attach them to my bag.  I never did; they just rode around with me the whole time.  Duh.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Wish I brought/bought:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Some form of hand sanitizer.  Japan is pretty clean, but occasionally you&#39;d like to have something to clean your hands and nothing is convenient.  My travel companion graciously lent me her sanitizer.  (Could have been an opportune moment for the wet wipes I brought, I suppose, but I&#39;d long forgotten that I had them, and sanitizer is more useful for situations like eating a sandwich after riding a subway.)</p></li><li><p>More chewing gum or breath mints, I like to have them.</p></li><li><p>Honestly, I would consider good quality active noise canceling headphones, even big over-ear ones.  Would have been nice for the plane, and there were shopping malls and busy streets that were very overstimulating (cutting noise out would have helped).  This may be a personal issue.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Considered buying/bringing, glad I didn&#39;t:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A daypack/purse.  Never needed it.  I&#39;d dump out my packing cubes and use the Synapse if needed.</p></li><li><p>Bar shampoo/conditioner.  <em>Every</em> place we stayed provided very nice products.  Would have been a waste.</p></li><li><p>Brush/comb.  Every place also provided free folding hairbrushes, I kept one :).  I could have also foregone toothbrush/paste, as every place had that too, but I liked mine.</p></li><li><p>A second pair of shoes.  Totally unnecessary, and I could have bought some (likely men&#39;s) shoes there if needed.</p></li><li><p>More warm clothing.  I could have bought some heattech etc. if needed, but it was very pleasant weather.</p></li><li><p>An umbrella.  They are cheap and easy to obtain.  We were given some old ones, and passed them on when we were done.</p></li><li><p>A Kindle.  I have a paperwhite that I enjoy, but for such a short and busy trip, the Libby app on my phone worked great.  That also means one fewer charging cable (though the paperwhite holds charge for a LONG time).</p></li></ul><p>---------</p><p><strong>Full packing list:</strong></p><p>Clothing (I kept to a black, gray, blue color scheme, stored almost everything in the two small packing cubes):</p><ul><li><p>Icebreaker merino short sleeve women&#39;s tees x3, gray and blue (would go a size up, at least 3/4 length sleeves, and only bring 2 next time - the scoop neck and short sleeves are a little revealing for Japan&#39;s sensibilities)</p></li><li><p>Nylon camisole x1, peach/flesh (unknown brand) (would have 2 next time)</p></li><li><p>Crew-neck Icebreaker merino sweater x1, gray, slim fit (would prefer a looser merino cardigan neck time)</p></li><li><p>Commando slip in black x1</p></li><li><p>Eddie Bauer Travex Destination shirtdress in black x1</p></li><li><p>Colorado Company reversible skirt (blue) x1</p></li><li><p>American Apparel mesh bralettes x2 (black) (would bring pink next time, without a camisole, the black could be seen through the shirts)</p></li><li><p>Leather belt x1, brand unknown (next time, I would get my pants tailored before I left, so I don&#39;t need a belt)</p></li><li><p>Prana Briann pant x1, black</p></li><li><p>Nylon/wool blend socks x3, brand unknown (would bring 2 next time, they didn&#39;t stink and were easy to wash)</p></li><li><p>Thin smartphone-compatible synthetic gloves x1, brand unknown (needed only once due to great weather, unlikely to bring again because coat sleeves were long enough to tuck hands into)</p></li><li><p>Meriwool &#34;Buff&#34; x1</p></li><li><p>BareTraps Ankle Boots</p></li><li><p>Long Tall Sally Point Zero packable coat and travel-pillow shaped stuff sack</p></li><li><p>Icebreaker hipkini underwear x3</p></li><li><p>Nylon running shorts x1, brand unknown (useful for sleeping and during bike ride, to wear over tights)</p></li><li><p>Fleece-lined black tights x2, synthetic, brand unknown</p></li><li><p>Eyeglasses x2 (would only bring 1 next time)</p></li><li><p>1 pair lever back silver cubic zirconia earrings, they never leave my ears</p></li></ul><p>Electronics:</p><ul><li><p>Apple iPhone 7 Plus with a wallet/kickstand case (T Mobile give you free data and texting in many countries)</p></li><li><p>USB-A lightning cords, one 3-foot and one 4-inch</p></li><li><p>Apple Watch Series 1</p></li><li><p>Apple Watch charging cord, 1 foot (bought in Japan after my travel charger died)</p></li><li><p>Anker Powercore Fusion</p></li><li><p>Apple AirPods</p></li></ul><p>Toiletries/medications (mostly stored in XS packing cube):</p><ul><li><p>Two contacts cases containing melatonin tablets, anti-chafe product, tooth powder, and blush/lipstain (would bring two contact wells full of tooth powder next time, one well lasted me about 14 days.  Didn&#39;t need to use the anti-chafe product, luckily).</p></li><li><p>1 oz jar (repurposed Cetaphil travel jar) of face lotion (used about 1/3-1/2 of this amount)</p></li><li><p>0.7 oz mini stick of deodorant (my tutorial is elsewhere on this sub)</p></li><li><p>Retainers and retainer case</p></li><li><p>Denture tablets for daily retainer cleansing (I used half a tablet per day, it worked)</p></li><li><p>Eyeliner and mascara</p></li><li><p>One small pill bottle with my commonly-used pills all mixed inside, including naproxen, loratadine, diphenhydramine, spironolactone, and some antibiotics for an infection I was treating at the beginning of the trip</p></li><li><p>Fluticasone inhaler</p></li><li><p>Adhesive skin pads and single-use alcohol wipes for applying them (for a skin condition)</p></li><li><p>Travel toothbrush (the kind you pull apart, where the head stores in its own handle - it was fine, but I MISSED my heavy, bulky electric toothbrush!)</p></li><li><p>Venus Snap razor handle with Mach 3 blade, protected by a binder clip (that binder clip came in handy for other things, too)</p></li><li><p>2-3 elastic hairties</p></li><li><p>Carmex lip balm in a tube</p></li><li><p>A 4 oz bottle of powdered Forever New detergent for hand washing (didn&#39;t use it all; Japan&#39;s hotels/hostels usually have washers available with automatic detergent)</p></li><li><p>A folding travel brush from a Japanese hotel</p></li><li><p>Nail clippers</p></li><li><p>Small travel tweezers and case</p></li><li><p>3 band-aids (did not need, thankfully)</p></li><li><p>Small tin of cuticle cream/bar, used as hand lotion</p></li></ul><p>Gear:</p><ul><li><p>Vapur 0.5L water bottle</p></li><li><p>Glasses case, polishing cloth (the only thing I would bring again is the polishing cloth, the glasses stay on my face)</p></li><li><p>Multitool (see above), which fit in a pen pocket and was easily retrieved via a strap clipped to a ring nearby.</p></li><li><p>2 pairs earplugs</p></li><li><p>Cotton hanky x1</p></li><li><p>Pack of gum (used it up all before the end of the trip)</p></li><li><p>Passport</p></li><li><p>Japan Rail Pass voucher</p></li><li><p>Credit card, debit card, driver&#39;s license (not sure why I brought this, backup ID I guess?)</p></li><li><p>Small wallet with big coin pocket, useful for coin-happy Japan (just something old I had around, it wasn&#39;t the ideal wallet for the task)</p></li><li><p>100 USD in case of emergencies</p></li><li><p>A pen with a twist retraction mechanism to avoid inadvertent pen stains</p></li><li><p>A small aluminum carabiner (didn&#39;t really use, but I have on other trips)</p></li><li><p>A few granola bars</p></li></ul></div></div>
