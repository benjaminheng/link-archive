<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="about-text">
                            <p>
pgBadger is a standalone Perl program that uses a javascript library (flotr2) to draw graphs so that you don&#39;t need to install any additional modules or other packages. Furthermore, this library gives us more features such as zooming. pgBadger also uses the Bootstrap javascript library and the FontAwesome webfont for better design. Everything is embedded.
			    </p>
                            <p>
pgBadger is able to autodetect your PostgreSQL log file format (syslog, stderr, csvlog or jsonlog) as well as pgbouncer log file. It is designed to parse huge log files as well as gzip compressed file. See a complete list of features below.
			    </p>
                            <p>
All charts are zoomable and can be saved as PNG images.
			    </p>
                            <p>
You can also limit pgBadger to only report errors or remove any part of the report using command line options.
			    </p>
                            <p>
			    pgBadger supports any custom format set into the log_line_prefix directive of
your postgresql.conf file as long as it at least specify a time escape sequence
(%t, %m or %n) and the process related escape sequence (%p or %c).
			    </p>
                            <p>
pgBadger allow parallel processing on a single log file and multiple files through the use of the -j or -J options and the number of CPUs as value.
			    </p>
                            <p>
If you want to save system performance you can also use log_duration instead of log_min_duration_statement to have reports on duration and number of queries only.
			    </p>
                            <p>
pgBadger supports an incremental mode that allow to construct incremental reports after successives runs of pgBadger. It is possible to run pgbadger each days or even more, each hours, and have cumulatives reports per day and per week. A top index page will allow you to go directly to the weekly and daily reports.

                <div>
                            <p>This release of pgBadger fix some issues reported by users since
past three months as well as some improvements:</p>
<pre>  * Add report about sessions idle time, computed using:
    &#34;total sessions time - total queries time / number of sessions
    This require that log_connection and log disconnection have been
    enabled and that log_min_duration_statement = 0 (all queries logged)
    to have a reliable value. This can help to know how much idle time
    is lost, and if a pooler transaction mode would be useful.
    This report is available in the &#34;Sessions&#34; tab of &#34;Global Stats&#34;
    and in the &#34;Sessions&#34; tab of &#34;General Activity&#34; reports (per hour).

		<h3><code>Version 11.3 - 2020-07-26</code></h3>
                <div>
                            <p>
This release of pgBadger fix several issues reported by users since
past four months. It also adds some new features and new command line
options:
</p>
<pre>  * Add autodetection of UTC timestamp to avoid applying timezone
    for graphs.
  * Add support to GCP CloudSQL json log format.
  * Add new option --dump-all-queries to use pgBadger to dump all
    queries to a text file, no report is generated just the full list
    of statements found in the PostgreSQL log. Bind parameters are
    inserted into the queries at their respective position.
  * Add new option -Q | --query-numbering used to add numbering of
    queries to the output when using options --dump-all-queries or
    --normalized-only.
  * Add new command line option --tempdir to set the directory where
    temporary files will be written. Can be useful on system that do
    not allow writing to /tmp.

		<h3><code>Version 11.2 - 2020-03-17</code></h3>
                <div>
                            <p>
This release of pgBadger fix several
issues reported by users since past six months. It also adds some new
features:
</p>
<pre>  * Add support and autodetection of AWS redshift log format.
  * Add support to pgbouncer 1.11 new log format.
  * Handle zstd and lz4 compression format
  * Allow to fully separate statistics build and HTML report build in
    incremental mode without having to read a log file. For example
    it is possible to run pgbadger each hours as follow:
    
        pgbadger -I -O &#34;/out-dir/data&#34; --noreport /var/log/postgresql*.log
    
    It just creates the data binary files in &#34;/out-dir/data&#34; then
   for example you can make reports each night for the next day in
   a separate directory `/out-dir/reports`:
    
        pgbadger -I -l &#34;/out-dir/data/LAST_PARSED&#34; -H &#34;/out-dir/reports&#34; /out-dir/data/2020/02/19/*.bin
    
    This require to set the path to the last parsed information, the
    path where HTML reports will be written and the binary data file
    of the day.
</pre>
<p>
There is also new command line options:
</p>
<pre>  * Add new command line option --explain-url used to override the url
    of the graphical explain tool. Default URL is:
    
        http://explain.depesz.com/?is_public=0&amp;is_anon=0&amp;plan=
    
    If you want to use a local install of PgExplain or an other tool.
    pgBadger will add the plan in text format escaped at the end of
    the URL.

  * Add new option --no-week to instruct pgbadger to not build weekly
    reports in incremental mode. Useful if it takes too much time and
    resources.

  * Add new command line option --command to be able to set a command
    that pgBadger will execute to retrieve log entries on stdin.
    pgBadger will open a pipe to the command and parse log entries
    generated by the command. For example:
    
      pgbadger -f stderr --command &#39;cat /var/log/postgresql.log&#39;
    
    which is the same as executing pgbadger with the log file directly
    as argument. The interest of this option is obvious if you have to
    modify the log file on the fly or that log entries are extracted
    from a program or generated from a database. For example:
    
      pgbadger -f csv --command &#39;psql dbname -c &#34;COPY jrn_log TO STDOUT (FORMAT CSV)&#34;&#39;
    
  * Add new command line option --noexplain to prevent pgBadger to
    parse and report explain plan written to log by auto_explain
    extension. This is useful if you have a PostgreSQL version &lt; 9.0
    where pgBadger generate broken reports when there is explain plan
    in log.
</pre>
<p>
Backward compatibility:
</p>
<pre>  - By default pgBadger will truncate queries up to 100000 characters.
    This arbitrary value and can be adjusted using option --maxlength.
    Previous behavior was to not truncate queries but this could
    lead in excessive resources usage. Limiting default size is safer
    and the size limit might allow no truncate in most cases. However
    queries will not be beautified if they exceed 25000 characters.

        Bind total duration: 4m46s
        Execute total duration: 44s71m
    This also fix previous report of &#34;Total query duration&#34; that was
    only reporting execute total duration.

    automatically. You can use -f rds if pgbadger is not able to
    auto-detect the log format.
  - Add new configuration option --month-report to be able to build
    monthly incremental reports.
  - Restore support to Windows operating system.

This release of pgBadger adds some major new features and fixes some
issues reported by users since the last four months. New features:
</p>
<pre>  - Regroup cursor related query (DECLARE,CLOSE,FETCH,MOVE) into new
    query type CURSOR.
  - Add top bind queries that generate the more temporary files.
    Require log_connection and log_disconnection be activated.
  - Add --exclude-client command line option to be able to exclude log
    entries for the specified client ip. Can be used multiple time.
  - Allow to use time only in --begin and --end filters.
  - Add -H, --html-dir option to be able to set a different path where
    HTML report must be written in incremental mode. Binary files stay
    on directory defined with -O, --outdir option.
  - Add -E | --explode option to explode the main report into one
    report per database. Global information not related to a database
    are added to the postgres database report.
  - Add per database report to incremental mode. In this mode there
    will be a sub directory per database with dedicated incremental
    reports.
  - Add support to Heroku&#39;s PostgreSQL logplex format. Log can be
    parsed using:

      heroku logs -p postgres | pgbadger -f logplex -o heroku.html -

  - When a query is &gt; 10Kb we first limit size of all constant string
    parameters to 30 characters and then the query is truncated to 10Kb.
    This prevent pgbadger to waste time/hang with very long queries
    when inserting bytea for example. The 10Kb limit can be controlled
    with the --maxlength command line parameter.
    The query is normalized or truncated to maxlength value only after
    this first attempt to limit size.
</pre>
<p>
This new release breaks backward compatibility with old binary or JSON
files. This also mean that incremental mode will not be able to read
old binary file. If you want to update pgBadger and keep you old reports
take care to upgrade at start of a new week otherwise weekly report will
be broken. pgBadger will print a warning and just skip the old binary
file.

                <div>
                            <p>
This release of pgBadger is a maintenance release that fixes some
log format autodetection issues another pgBouncer log parsing issue
reported by users. There is also a new feature:
</p>
<pre>    The -o | --outfile option can now be used multiple time to dump
    output in several format in a single command. For example:
        pgbadger -o out.html -o out.json /log/pgsql-11.log
    will create two reports in html and json format saved in the
    two corresponding files.

		<h3><code>Version 10.2 - 2018-12-27</code></h3>
                <div>
                            <p>
This release of pgBadger is a maintenance release that fixes issues
reported by users during last three months. There is also some new
features:
</p>
<pre>  * Add support to pgbouncer 1.8 Stats log format.
  * Auto adjust javascript graph timezone.
  * Add support to http or ftp remote PostgreSQL log file download.
    The log file is parsed during the download using curl command
    and never saved to disk. With ssh remote log parsing you can use
    uri as command line argument to specify the PostgreSQL log file.
    
            ssh://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log
            http://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log.gz
            ftp://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log
    
    with http and ftp protocol you need to specify the log file format
    at end of the uri:
    
            http://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log:stderr
    
    You can specify multiple uri for log files to be parsed. This is
    useful when you have pgbouncer log file on a remote host and
    PostgreSQL logs in the local host.

    With ssh protocol you can use wild card too like with remote
    mode, ex: ssh://localhost/postgresql-10-main.log*
    
    Old syntax to parse remote log file using -r option is still
    working but is obsolete and might be removed in future versions.
</pre>
<p>
There is a new command line option:
</p>
<pre>  * Add --exclude-db option to compute report about everything except
    the specified database.
</pre>

		<h3><code>Version 10.1 - 2018-09-12</code></h3>
                <div>
                            <p>
This release of pgBadger is a maintenance release that fixes reports
in incremental mode and multiprocess with -j option. Log parsing from
standard input was also broken. If you are using v10.0 please upgrade
now.
</p>
<pre>  - Add test on pgbouncer log parser.
  - Some little performances improvment.
  - Fix not a valid file descriptor at pgbadger line 12314.
  - Fix unwanted newline in progressbar at startup.
  - Remove circleci files from the project.
  - Remove dependency of bats and jq for the test suite, they are
    replaced with Test::Simple and JSON::XS.
  - Add more tests especially for incremental mode and input from
    stdin that was broken in release 10.0.
  - Sync pgbadger, pod, and README, and fix some syntax errors.
    Thanks to Christoph Berg for the patch.
  - Add documentation on how to install Perl module JSON::XS from
    apt and yum repositories.
  - Fix URI for CSS in incremental mode. Thanks to Floris van Nee
    for the report.
  - Fix fatal error when looking for log from STDIN. Thanks to
    Jacek Szpot for the report.
  - Fixes SED use for OSX builds. Thanks to Steve Newson for the
    patch.
  - Fix illegal division by zero in incrental mode. Thanks to
    aleszeleny for the report.
  - Replace SQL::Beautify with v3.1 of pgFormatter::Beautify.
</pre>
<p>
Thanks a lot to Etienne Bersac from Dalibo who have initiate the
pgbadger test suite and added information about contributing in
the documentation. Unitary tests are still not complete but tests
of features fixed in this maintenance release have been added.

                            <p>
This major release of pgBadger is a port to bootstrap 3 and a version
upgrade of all resources files (CSS and Javascript). There&#39;s also some
bugs fixes and features enhancements.
</p>
<p>
Backward compatibility with old incremental report might be preserved.
</p>
<pre>  - Sources and licences of resources files are now on a dedicated
    subdirectory. A script to update their minified version embedded
    in pgbager script has been added. Thanks to Christoph Berg for
    the help and feature request.

  - Try to detect user/database/host from connection strings if
    log_connection is enabled and log_line_prefix doesn&#39;t include
    them.
    
    Extend the regex to autodetect database name, user name, client
    ip address and application name. The regex now are the following:
    
    	db =&gt; qr/(?:db|database)=([^,]*)/;
    	user =&gt; qr/(?:user|usr)=([^,]*)/;
    	client =&gt; qr/(?:client|remote|ip|host)=([^,]*)/;
    	appname =&gt; qr/(?:app|application)=([^,]*)/;
    
  - Add backward compatibility with older version of pgbadger in
    incremental mode by creating a subdirectory for new CSS and
    Javascript files. This subdirectory is named with the major
    version number of pgbadger.
    
  - Increase the size of the pgbadger logo that appears too small
    with the new font size.

  - Normalize detailed information in all reports.

  - Fix duplicate copy icon in locks report.

  - Fix missing chart on histogram of session time. Thanks to
    Guillaume Lelarge for the report.

  - Add LICENSE file noting the licenses used by the resource
    files. Thanks to Christoph Berg for the patch.

  - Add patch to jqplot library to fix an infinite loop when trying
    to download some charts. Thanks to Julien Tachoires for the help
    to solve this issue.
    
  - Script tools/updt_embedded_rsc.pl will apply the patch to resource
    file resources/jquery.jqplot.js and doesn&#39;t complain if it has
    already been applied.

  - Remove single last comma at end of pie chart dataset. Thanks to
    Julien Tachoires for the report.

  - Change display of normalized error

  - Remove unused or auto-generated files

  - Update all resources files (js+css) and create a directory to
    include source of javascript libraries used in pgbadger. There is
    also a new script tools/updt_embedded_rsc.pl the can be used to
    generate the minified version of those files and embedded them
    into pgbadger.  This script will also embedded the FontAwesome.otf
    open truetype font into the fontawesome.css file.
