<p dir="auto">The font for developers who like Minecraft a bit <em>too</em> much.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Notice: This project is not affiliated with Minecraft or Mojang in any way and is exclusively a fan project. This font emulates the typeface of the font used in the Minecraft UI, but it does not include any assets or font files from the original game.</em></p>
<h2 dir="auto">Features</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Minecraft!
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The characters in this font were based around the <a href="https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font">typeface</a> used in the Minecraft UI, with a select few glyphs updated for better readability and spacing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monospaced!
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Each character has been carefully redesigned to work in a monospaced font</li>
<li>Thin characters like &#34;i&#34; and &#34;l&#34; have been reworked with tasteful tails and serifs to look better in a monospaced environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Programming ligatures!
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Add some spice to your programming life with all new ligature characters</li>
<li>Arrows now look like arrows and comparison operators are easier to see at a glance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
