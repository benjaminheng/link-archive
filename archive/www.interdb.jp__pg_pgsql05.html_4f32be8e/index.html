<p>
Concurrency Control is a mechanism that maintains atomicity and isolation,
which are two properties of the ACID,
when several transactions run concurrently in the database.

</p>

<p>
There are three broad concurrency control techniques,
i.e.
<i>Multi-version Concurrency Control</i> (MVCC),
<i>Strict Two-Phase Locking</i> (S2PL),
and <i>Optimistic Concurrency Control</i> (OCC),
and each technique has many variations.


In MVCC, each write operation creates a new version of a data item while retaining the old version.
When a transaction reads a data item, the system selects one of the versions to ensure isolation of the individual transaction.

The main advantage of MVCC is that &#39;<i>readers don’t block writers, and writers don’t block readers</i>&#39;, in contrast, for example, an S2PL-based system must block readers when a writer writes an item because the writer acquires an exclusive lock for the item.


PostgreSQL and some RDBMSs use a variation of MVCC called <b>Snapshot Isolation (SI)</b>.
</p>

<p>
To implement SI,
some RDBMSs, e.g., Oracle, use rollback segments.
When writing a new data item, the old version of the item is written to the rollback segment,
 and subsequently the new item is overwritten to the data area.

PostgreSQL uses a simpler method.
A new data item is inserted directly into the relevant table page.

When reading items, 
PostgreSQL selects the appropriate version of an item in response to an individual transaction by applying <b>visibility check rules</b>.
</p>


<p>
SI does not allow the three anomalies defined in the ANSI SQL-92 standard, i.e.  <i>Dirty Reads</i>, <i>Non-Repeatable Reads</i>, and <i>Phantom Reads</i>.

However, SI cannot achieve true serializability because it allows serialization anomalies, such as <i>Write Skew</i> and <i>Read-only Transaction Skew</i>.

Note that the ANSI SQL-92 standard based on the classical serializability definition is <b>not</b> equivalent to the definition in modern theory.

To deal with this issue, <b>Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)</b> has been added as of version 9.1.

SSI can detect the serialization anomalies and can resolve the conflicts caused by such anomalies.
Thus, PostgreSQL version 9.1 and later provides a true SERIALIZABLE isolation level.
 (In addition, SQL Server also uses SSI, Oracle still uses only SI.)

<p>
This chapter comprises the following four parts:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Part 1:</b> Sections 5.1. — 5.3.</li>
<p>
This part provides basic information required for understanding the subsequent parts.
</p>
<p>
Sections 5.1 and 5.2 describe transaction ids and tuple structure, respectively.
Section 5.3 exhibits how tuples are inserted, deleted, and updated.
</p>

<li><b>Part 2:</b> Sections 5.4.  — 5.6.</li>
<p>
This part illustrates the key features required for implementing the concurrency control mechanism.
</p>

<p>
Sections 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6 describe the commit log (clog), which holds all transaction states, 
transaction snapshots, and the visibility check rules, respectively.
</p>

<li><b>Part 3:</b> Sections 5.7.  — 5.9.</li>
<p>
This part describes the concurrency control in PostgreSQL using specific examples.
</p>

<p>
Section 5.7 describes the visibility check.
This section also shows how the three anomalies defined in the ANSI SQL standard are prevented.
Section 5.8 describes preventing <i>Lost Updates</i>,
and Section 5.9 briefly describes SSI.
</p>

<li><b>Part 4:</b> Section 5.10.</li>
<p>
This part describes several maintenance process required to permanently running the concurrency control mechanism.
The maintenance processes are performed by vacuum processing, which is described in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql06.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter 6</a>.
</p>

</ul>

<p>
This chapter focuses on the topics that are unique to PostgreSQL, although there are many concurrency control-related topics.
Note that descriptions of deadlock prevention and lock modes are omitted
(refer to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/explicit-locking.html" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for more information).
</p>

<br/>
<div>
  <p><i>  Transaction Isolation Level in PostgreSQL</i>
  </p>
  <div>
<p>
PostgreSQL-implemented transaction isolation levels are described in the following table:
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Isolation Level</th>
<th>Dirty Reads</th>
<th>Non-repeatable Read</th>
<th>Phantom Read</th>
<th>Serialization Anomaly</th>

</tr><tr>

<td>READ COMMITTED</td>
<td>Not possible</td>
<td>Possible</td>
<td>Possible</td>
<td>Possible</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>REPEATABLE READ<sup>*1</sup></td>
<td>Not possible</td>
<td>Not possible</td>
<td><span color="#0000ff">Not possible</span> in PG; See <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql05.html#_5.7.2." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 5.7.2.</a><br/>(Possible in ANSI SQL)</td>
<td>Possible</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>SERIALIZABLE</td>
<td>Not possible</td>
<td>Not possible</td>
<td>Not possible</td>
<td>Not possible</td>

</tr><tr>

</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
*1 : In version 9.0 and earlier,
this level had been used as ‘SERIALIZABLE’ because it does not allow the three anomalies defined in the ANSI SQL-92 standard.
However, with the implementation of SSI in version 9.1,
this level has changed to &#39;REPEATABLE READ&#39; and a true SERIALIZABLE level was introduced.
</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div><p>
PostgreSQL uses SSI for DML (Data Manipulation Language, e.g, SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE), and 2PL for DDL (Data Definition Language, e.g., CREATE TABLE, etc).
</p></div>
<br/>



  </div>
<p><h2><a id="_5.1." name="_5.1."></a>5.1. Transaction ID</h2></p>
 <div>


<p>
Whenever a transaction begins, 
a unique identifier, referred to as a <b>transaction id (txid)</b>, is assigned by the transaction manager.

PostgreSQL&#39;s txid is a 32-bit unsigned integer, approximately 4.2 billion (thousand millions).
If you execute the built-in <i>txid_current()</i> function after a transaction starts,
 the function returns the current txid as follows.
</p>

<pre>testdb=# BEGIN;
BEGIN
testdb=# SELECT txid_current();
 txid_current 
--------------
          100
(1 row)
</pre>

<p>
PostgreSQL reserves the following three special txids:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>0</b> means <b>Invalid</b> txid.
</li>

<li><b>1</b> means <b>Bootstrap</b> txid, which is only used in the initialization of the database cluster.
</li>

<li><b>2</b> means <b>Frozen</b> txid, which is described in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql05.html#_5.10.1." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 5.10.1</a>.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Txids can be compared with each other.
For example, at the viewpoint of txid 100,
txids which are greater than 100 are ‘in the future’ and they are <i>invisible</i> from the txid 100;
txids which are less than 100 are ‘in the past’ and <i>visible</i> (Fig. 5.1 a)).
</p>



<p><b>Fig. 5.1. Transaction ids in PostgreSQL.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.1. Transaction ids in PostgreSQL." data-src="./img/fig-5-01.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


<p>
Since the txid space is insufficient in practical systems,
PostgreSQL treats the txid space as a circle.

The previous 2.1 billion txids are &#39;in the past&#39;, 
and the next 2.1 billion txids are &#39;in the future&#39; (Fig. 5.1 b).
</p>

<p>
Note that the so-called <i>txid wraparound problem</i> is described in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql05.html#_5.10.1.">Section 5.10.1</a>. 
</p>

<br/>
<div><p>
Note that BEGIN command does not be assigned a txid.

In PostgreSQL,
when the first command is executed after a BEGIN command executed, a tixd is assigned by the transaction manager,
and then its transaction starts.
</p></div>
<br/>




  </div>
<p><h2><a id="_5.2." name="_5.2."></a>5.2. Tuple Structure</h2></p>
 <div>


<p>
Heap tuples in table pages are classified as a usual data tuple and a TOAST tuple. This section describes only the usual tuple.
</p>

<p>
A heap tuple comprises three parts,
i.e.
the HeapTupleHeaderData structure, NULL bitmap, and user data (Fig. 5.2).
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.2. Tuple structure.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.2. Tuple structure." data-src="./img/fig-5-02.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


<br/>



<p>
While the HeapTupleHeaderData structure contains seven fields,
four fields are required in the subsequent sections.
</p>


<ul>
<li><b>t_xmin</b> holds the txid of the transaction that inserted this tuple.
</li>

<li><b>t_xmax</b> holds the txid of the transaction that deleted or updated this tuple.
If this tuple has not been deleted or updated, t_xmax is set to <i>0</i>, which means INVALID.
</li>

<li>
<b>t_cid</b> holds the command id (cid), which means how many SQL commands were executed before this command was executed within the current transaction beginning from 0.

For example, assume that we execute three INSERT commands within a single transaction: &#39;BEGIN; INSERT; INSERT; INSERT; COMMIT;&#39;.
If the first command inserts this tuple, t_cid is set to 0.
If the second command inserts this, t_cid is set to 1, and so on.
</li>

<li><b>t_ctid</b> holds the tuple identifier (tid) that points to itself or a new tuple.

tid, described in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql01.html#_1.3." target="_blank">Section 1.3</a>, is used to identify a tuple within a table.

When this tuple is updated, the t_ctid of this tuple points to the new tuple;
otherwise, the t_ctid points to itself.
</li>

</ul>


 






  </div>
<p><h2><a id="_5.3." name="_5.3."></a>5.3. Inserting, Deleting and Updating Tuples</h2></p>
 <div>


<p>
This section describes how tuples are inserted, deleted, and updated.
Then, the <i>Free Space Map (FSM)</i>, which is used to insert and update tuples, is briefly described.
</p>


<p>
To focus on tuples, page headers and line pointers are not represented in the following.
Figure 5.3 shows an example of how tuples are represented.
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.3. Representation of tuples.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.3. Representation of tuples." data-src="./img/fig-5-03.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.3.1." name="_5.3.1."></a>5.3.1. Insertion</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
With the insertion operation,
a new tuple is inserted directly into a page of the target table (Fig. 5.4).
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.4. Tuple insertion.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.4. Tuple insertion." data-src="./img/fig-5-04.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


<p>
Suppose that a tuple is inserted in a page by a transaction whose txid is 99.
In this case, the header fields of the inserted tuple are set as follows.
</p>


<ul>
<li>Tuple_1:
 <ul>
  <li><b>t_xmin</b> is set to 99 because this tuple is inserted by txid 99.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_xmax</b> is set to 0 because this tuple has not been deleted or updated.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_cid</b> is set to 0 because this tuple is the first tuple inserted by txid 99.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_ctid</b> is set to (0,1), which points to itself, because this is the latest tuple.
  </li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<div>
  <p><i>  pageinspect</i>
  </p>
  <div>

<p>
PostgreSQL provides an extension <i>pageinspect</i>, which is a contribution module, to show the contents of the database pages.
</p>


<pre>testdb=# CREATE EXTENSION pageinspect;
CREATE EXTENSION
testdb=# CREATE TABLE tbl (data text);
CREATE TABLE
testdb=# INSERT INTO tbl VALUES(&#39;A&#39;);
INSERT 0 1
testdb=# SELECT lp as tuple, t_xmin, t_xmax, t_field3 as t_cid, t_ctid 
                FROM heap_page_items(get_raw_page(&#39;tbl&#39;, 0));
 tuple | t_xmin | t_xmax | t_cid | t_ctid 
-------+--------+--------+-------+--------
     1 |     99 |      0 |     0 | (0,1)
(1 row)
</pre>
  </div>
</div>
<br/>




  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.3.2." name="_5.3.2."></a>5.3.2. Deletion</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
In the deletion operation,
the target tuple is deleted logically.
The value of the txid that executes the DELETE command is set to the t_xmax of the tuple (Fig. 5.5).
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.5. Tuple deletion.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.5. Tuple deletion." data-src="./img/fig-5-05.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


<p>
Suppose that Tuple_1 is deleted by txid 111.
In this case, the header fields of Tuple_1 are set as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuple_1:
 <ul>
  <li><b>t_xmax</b> is set to 111.
  </li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If txid 111 is committed, Tuple_1 is no longer required.
Generally, unneeded tuples are referred to as <b>dead tuples</b> in PostgreSQL. 
</p>

<p>
Dead tuples should eventually be removed from pages.
Cleaning dead tuples is referred to as <b>VACUUM</b> processing, which is described in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql06.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter 6</a>.
</p>


  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.3.3." name="_5.3.3."></a>5.3.3. Update</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
In the update operation,
PostgreSQL logically deletes the latest tuple and inserts a new one (Fig. 5.6).
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.6. Update the row twice.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.6. Update the row twice." data-src="./img/fig-5-06.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


<p>
Suppose that the row, which has been inserted by txid 99, is updated twice by txid 100.
</p>

<p>
When the first UPDATE command is executed,
Tuple_1 is logically deleted by setting txid 100 to the <i>t_xmax</i>,
and then Tuple_2 is inserted.
Then, the <i>t_ctid</i> of Tuple_1 is rewritten to point to Tuple_2.
The header fields of both Tuple_1 and Tuple_2 are as follows.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Tuple_1:
 <ul>
  <li><b>t_xmax</b> is set to 100.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_ctid</b> is rewritten from (0, 1) to (0, 2).
  </li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Tuple_2:
 <ul>
  <li><b>t_xmin</b> is set to 100.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_xmax</b> is set to 0.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_cid</b> is set to 0.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_ctid</b> is set to (0,2).
  </li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
When the second UPDATE command is executed, as in the first UPDATE command, 
Tuple_2 is logically deleted and Tuple_3 is inserted.

The header fields of both Tuple_2 and Tuple_3 are as follows.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Tuple_2:
 <ul>
  <li><b>t_xmax</b> is set to 100.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_ctid</b> is rewritten from (0, 2) to (0, 3).
  </li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Tuple_3:
 <ul>
  <li><b>t_xmin</b> is set to 100.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_xmax</b> is set to 0.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_cid</b> is set to 1.
  </li>
  <li><b>t_ctid</b> is set to (0,3).
  </li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As with the delete operation, if txid 100 is committed, Tuple_1 and Tuple_2 will be dead tuples, and,
if txid 100 is aborted, Tuple_2 and Tuple_3 will be dead tuples.
</p>



  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.3.4." name="_5.3.4."></a>5.3.4. Free Space Map</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
When inserting a heap or an index tuple,
PostgreSQL uses the <b>FSM</b> of the corresponding table or index
to select the page which can be inserted it. 
</p>

<p>
As mentioned in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql01.html#_1.2.3." target="_blank">Section 1.2.3</a>,
all tables and indexes have respective FSMs.

Each FSM stores the information about the free space capacity of each page within the corresponding table or index file.
</p>

<p>
All FSMs are stored with the suffix &#39;fsm&#39;,
and they are loaded into shared memory if necessary.
</p>



<br/>
<div>
  <p>
pg_freespacemap
  </p>
  <div>
<p>
The extension <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgfreespacemap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_freespacemap</a> provides the freespace of the specified table/index.
The following query shows the freespace ratio of each page in the specified table.
</p>

<pre>testdb=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_freespacemap;
CREATE EXTENSION

testdb=# SELECT *, round(100 * avail/8192 ,2) as &#34;freespace ratio&#34;
                FROM pg_freespace(&#39;accounts&#39;);

  </div>
<p><h2><a id="_5.4." name="_5.4."></a>5.4. Commit Log (clog)</h2></p>
 <div>


<p>
PostgreSQL holds the statuses of transactions in the <b>Commit Log</b>.

The Commit Log, often called the <b>clog</b>,
is allocated to the shared memory,
and is used throughout transaction processing.
</p>

<p>
This section describes the the status of transactions in PostgreSQL,
how the clog operates, and maintenance of the clog.
</p>



  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.4.1" name="_5.4.1"></a>5.4.1 Transaction Status</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
PostgreSQL defines four transaction states,
i.e. IN_PROGRESS, COMMITTED, ABORTED, and SUB_COMMITTED.
</p>

<p>
The first three statuses are obvious.
For example, when a transaction is in progress, its status is IN_PROGRESS, etc.
</p>

<p>
SUB_COMMITTED is for sub-transactions, and its description is omitted in this document.
</p>


  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.4.2." name="_5.4.2."></a>5.4.2. How Clog Performs</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
The clog comprises one or more 8 KB pages in shared memory.
The clog logically forms an array.
The indices of the array correspond to the respective transaction ids,
and each item in the array holds the status of the corresponding transaction id.
Figure 5.7 shows the clog and how it operates.
</p>



<p><b>Fig. 5.7. How the clog operates.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.7. How the clog operates." data-src="./img/fig-5-07.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
       <div id="small">
<hr/>

<ul>
<li><b>T1:</b>
txid 200 commits;
the status of txid 200 is changed from IN_PROGRESS to COMMITTED.
</li>

<li><b>T2:</b>
txid 201 aborts;
the status of txid 201 is changed from IN_PROGRESS to ABORTED.
</li>
</ul>

            </div>
  </div>


<p>
When the current txid advances and the clog can no longer store it, a new page is appended.
</p>

<p>
When the status of a transaction is needed, the internal functions are invoked. Those functions read the clog and return the status of the requested transaction.

(See also <i> &#39;Hint Bits&#39;</i> in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql05.html#_5.7.1.">Section 5.7.1</a>.)
</p>


  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.4.3." name="_5.4.3."></a>5.4.3. Maintenance of the Clog</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
When PostgreSQL shuts down or whenever the checkpoint process runs,
the data of the clog are written into files stored under the <b>pg_xact</b> subdirectory.
(Note that pg_xact had been called <i>pg_clog</i> in Version 9.6 or earlier.)

These files are named <i>0000</i>, <i>0001</i>, etc.

The maximum file size is 256 KB.

For example, when the clog uses eight pages (the first page to the eighth page; the total size is 64 KB), its data are written into 0000 (64 KB), 
and with 37 pages (296 KB), the data are written into 0000 and 0001,
whose sizes are 256 KB and 40 KB, respectively.
</p>

<p>
When PostgreSQL starts up, the data stored in the pg_xact&#39;s files are loaded to initialize the clog.
</p>

<p>
The size of the clog continuously increases because a new page is appended whenever the clog is filled up.

However, not all data in the clog are necessary.

Vacuum processing, described in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql06.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapter 6</a>, regularly removes such old data (both the clog pages and files).

Details about removing the clog data is described in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql06.html#_6.4." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 6.4</a>.
</p>



  </div>
<p><h2><a id="_5.5." name="_5.5."></a>5.5. Transaction Snapshot</h2></p>
 <div>


<p>
A <b>transaction snapshot</b> is a dataset that stored information about whether all transactions are active,
 at a certain point in time for an individual transaction.
Here an active transaction means it is in progress or has not yet started. 
</p>

<p>
PostgreSQL internally defines the textual representation format of transaction snapshots as &#39;100:100:&#39;.
For example, &#39;100:100:&#39; means &#39;txids that are less than 99 are not active, and txids that are equal or greater than 100 are active&#39;.

In the following descriptions, this convenient representation form is used.
If you are not familiar with it,
see <i></i> below.
</p>

<br/>
<div>
  <p><i>  The built-in function txid_current_snapshot and its textual representation format</i>
  </p>
  <div>
<p>
The function <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-info.html#FUNCTIONS-TXID-SNAPSHOT">txid_current_snapshot</a> shows a snapshot of the current transaction.
</p>

<pre>testdb=# SELECT txid_current_snapshot();
 txid_current_snapshot 
-----------------------
 100:104:100,102
(1 row)
</pre>


<p>
The textual representation of the txid_current_snapshot is <b>‘xmin:xmax:xip_list’</b>,
and the components are described as follows.
</p>

<ul>
<li>xmin</li>Earliest txid that is still active.
All earlier transactions will either be committed and visible, or rolled back and dead.

<li>xmax</li>  First as-yet-unassigned txid.
All txids greater than or equal to this are not yet started as of the time of the snapshot, and thus invisible.

<li>xip_list</li>    Active txids at the time of the snapshot.
The list includes only active txids between xmin and xmax.
</ul>

<p>
For example, in the snapshot ‘100:104:100,102’, xmin is ‘100’, xmax ‘104’, and xip_list ‘100,102’.
</p>

<p>
Two specific examples are shown in the following:
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.8. Examples of transaction snapshot representation.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.8. Examples of transaction snapshot representation." data-src="./img/fig-5-08.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


<p>
The first example is <b>&#39;100:100:&#39;</b>.
This snapshot means the following (Fig. 5.8(a)):
</p>

<ul>
<li>txids that are equal or less than 99 are <b>not</b> <i>active</i> because xmin is 100.</li>
<li>txids that are equal or greater than 100 are <i>active</i> because xmax is 100.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The second example is <b>&#39;100:104:100,102&#39;</b>.
 This snapshot means the following (Fig. 5.8(b)):
</p>

<ul>
<li>txids that are equal or less than 99 are <b>not</b> <i>active</i>.</li>

<p>
Transaction snapshots are provided by the transaction manager. 

In the READ COMMITTED isolation level, the transaction obtains a snapshot whenever an SQL command is executed;
otherwise (REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE), the transaction only gets a snapshot when the first SQL command is executed.

The obtained transaction snapshot is used for a visibility check of tuples, which is described in Section 5.7.
</p>


<p>
When using the obtained snapshot for the visibility check,
<i>active</i> transactions in the snapshot must be treated as <i>in progress</i> 
even if they have actually been committed or aborted.

This rule is important because it causes the difference in the behaviour between READ COMMITTED and REPEATABLE READ (or SERIALIZABLE).
We refer to this rule repeatedly in the following sections.
</p>

<p>
In the remainder of this section, the transaction manager and transactions are described
using a specific scenario Fig. 5.9.
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.9. Transaction manager and transactions.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.9. Transaction manager and transactions." data-src="./img/fig-5-09.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


<p>
The transaction manager always holds information about currently running transactions.

Suppose that three transactions start one after another,
and the isolation level of Transaction_A and Transaction_B are READ COMMITTED,
and that of Transaction_C is REPEATABLE READ.
</p>


<ul>
<li><b>T1:</b></li>
<p>
Transaction_A starts and executes the first SELECT command.

When executing the first command, Transaction_A requests the txid and snapshot of this moment.

In this scenario,
the transaction manager assigns txid 200, and returns the transaction snapshot &#39;200:200:&#39;.
</p>

<li><b>T2:</b></li>
<p>
Transaction_B starts and executes the first SELECT command.
The transaction manager assigns txid 201, and returns the transaction snapshot &#39;200:200:&#39;
because Transaction_A (txid 200) is in progress.
Thus, Transaction_A cannot be seen from Transaction_B.
</p>


<li><b>T3:</b></li>
<p>
Transaction_C starts and executes the first SELECT command.
The transaction manager assigns txid 202, and returns the transaction snapshot &#39;200:200:&#39;,
thus, Transaction_A and Transaction_B cannot be seen from Transaction_C.
</p>


<li><b>T4:</b></li>
<p>
Transaction_A has been committed.
The transaction manager removes the information about this transaction.
</p>

<li><b>T5:</b></li>
<p>
Transaction_B and Transaction_C execute their respective SELECT commands.
</p>

<p>
Transaction_B requires a transaction snapshot because it is in the READ COMMITTED level.
In this scenario, Transaction_B obtains a new snapshot &#39;201:201:&#39;
because Transaction_A (txid 200) is committed.
Thus, Transaction_A is no longer invisible from Transaction_B.
</p>

<p>
Transaction_C does not require a transaction snapshot because it is in the REPEATABLE READ level
and uses the obtained snapshot, i.e. &#39;200:200:&#39;.
Thus, Transaction_A is still invisible from Transaction_C.
</p>

</ul>

<p><h2><a id="_5.6." name="_5.6."></a>5.6. Visibility Check Rules</h2></p>
 <div>


<p>
Visibility check rules are a set of rules used to determine whether each tuple is visible or invisible
using both the t_xmin and t_xmax of the tuple, the clog, and the obtained transaction snapshot.

These rules are too complicated to explain in detail.
Therefore this document shows the minimal rules required for the subsequent descriptions.
In the following,
we omit the rules related to sub-transactions
and ignore discussion about t_ctid, i.e. we do not consider tuples that have been updated more than twice within a transaction.
</p>


<p>
The number of selected rules is ten, and they can be classified into three cases.
</p>



  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.6.1." name="_5.6.1."></a>5.6.1. Status of t_xmin is ABORTED</h3></p>
 <div>




<p>
A tuple whose t_xmin status is ABORTED is always <i>invisible</i> (Rule 1)
because the transaction that inserted this tuple has been aborted.
</p>

<pre> /* t_xmin status == ABORTED */
<b>Rule 1:</b><b> IF</b> t_xmin status is &#39;ABORTED&#39; <b>THEN</b>
                  <b>RETURN</b> &#39;Invisible&#39;
            <b>END IF</b>
</pre>

<p>
This rule is explicitly expressed as the following mathematical expression.
</p>


<ul>
<li><b>Rule 1:</b> If Status(t_xmin) = ABORTED ⇒ Invisible
</li>
</ul>




  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.6.2." name="_5.6.2."></a>5.6.2. Status of t_xmin is IN_PROGRESS</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
A tuple whose t_xmin status is IN_PROGRESS is essentially <i>invisible</i> (Rules 3 and 4),
 except under one condition.
</p>

<pre> /* t_xmin status == IN_PROGRESS */
              <b>IF</b> t_xmin status is &#39;IN_PROGRESS&#39; <b>THEN</b>
            	   <b>IF</b> t_xmin = current_txid <b>THEN</b>
<b>Rule 2:</b>              <b>IF</b> t_xmax = INVALID <b>THEN</b>
			      <b>RETURN</b> &#39;Visible&#39;
<b>Rule 3:</b>              <b>ELSE</b>  /* this tuple has been deleted or updated by the current transaction itself. */
			      <b>RETURN</b> &#39;Invisible&#39;
                         <b>END IF</b>
<b>Rule 4:</b>        <b>ELSE</b>   /* t_xmin ≠ current_txid */
		          <b>RETURN</b> &#39;Invisible&#39;
                   <b>END IF</b>
             <b>END IF</b>
</pre>


<p>
If this tuple is inserted by another transaction and the status of t_xmin is IN_PROGRESS,
this tuple is obviously <i>invisible</i> (Rule 4).
</p>

<p>
If t_xmin is equal to the current txid (i.e., this tuple is inserted by the current transaction) and t_xmax is <b>not</b> INVALID,
this tuple is <i>invisible</i>
because it has been updated or deleted by the current transaction (Rule 3).
</p>

<p>
The exception condition is the case whereby this tuple is inserted by the current transaction and t_xmax is INVALID.
In this case, this tuple must be <i>visible</i> from the current transaction (Rule 2) because this tuple is the tuple inserted by the current transaction itself.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Rule 2:</b> If Status(t_xmin) = IN_PROGRESS ∧ t_xmin = current_txid ∧ t_xmax = INVAILD ⇒ Visible
</li>
<li><b>Rule 3:</b> If Status(t_xmin) = IN_PROGRESS ∧ t_xmin = current_txid ∧ t_xmax ≠ INVAILD ⇒ Invisible
</li>
<li><b>Rule 4:</b> If Status(t_xmin) = IN_PROGRESS ∧ t_xmin ≠  current_txid ⇒ Invisible
</li>
</ul>



  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.6.3." name="_5.6.3."></a>5.6.3. Status of t_xmin is COMMITTED</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
A tuple whose t_xmin status is COMMITTED is  <i>visible</i> (Rules 6,8, and 9), except under three conditions.
</p>

<pre> /* t_xmin status == COMMITTED */
            <b>IF</b> t_xmin status is &#39;COMMITTED&#39; <b>THEN</b>

            	 <b>END IF</b>
            <b>END IF</b>
</pre>

<p>
Rule 6 is obvious because t_xmax is INVALID or ABORTED.

Three exception conditions and both Rules 8 and 9 are described as follows.
</p>

<p>
The first exception condition is that t_xmin is <i>active</i> in the obtained transaction snapshot (Rule 5).
Under this condition,
this tuple is <i>invisible</i>
because t_xmin should be treated as in progress. 
</p>

<p>
The second exception condition is that
t_xmax is the current txid (Rule 7).
Under this condition,
as with Rule 3,
this tuple is <i>invisible</i>
because it has been updated or deleted by this transaction itself.
</p>

<p>
In contrast,
if the status of t_xmax is IN_PROGRESS and t_xmax is not the current txid (Rule 8),
the tuple is <i>visible</i>
because it has not been deleted.
</p>

<p>
The third exception condition is that the status of t_xmax is COMMITTED and t_xmax is <b>not</b> active in the obtained transaction snapshot (Rule 10).
Under this condition,
this tuple is <i>invisible</i>
because it has been updated or deleted by another transaction.
</p>

<p>
In contrast,
if the status of t_xmax is COMMITTED but t_xmax is active in the obtained transaction snapshot (Rule 9),
the tuple is <i>visible</i> because t_xmax should be treated as in progress.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Rule 5:</b> If Status(t_xmin) = COMMITTED ∧ Snapshot(t_xmin) = active  ⇒ Invisible
</li>
<li><b>Rule 6:</b> If Status(t_xmin) = COMMITTED ∧ (t_xmax = INVALID ∨ Status(t_xmax) = ABORTED) ⇒ Visible
</li>

<p><h2><a id="_5.7." name="_5.7."></a>5.7. Visibility Check</h2></p>
 <div>
  <p>
This section describes how PostgreSQL performs a visibility check,
i.e. how heap tuples of the appropriate versions in a given transaction are selected.
This section also describes how PostgreSQL prevents the anomalies defined in the ANSI SQL-92 Standard: Dirty Reads, Repeatable Reads and Phantom Reads.
</p>
 </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.7.1." name="_5.7.1."></a>5.7.1. Visibility Check</h3></p>
 <div>
  <div>


<p>
Figure 5.10 shows a scenario to describe the visibility check. 
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.10. Scenario to describe visibility check.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.10. Scenario to describe visibility check." data-src="./img/fig-5-10.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>



<p>
In the scenario shown in Fig. 5.10, SQL commands are executed in the following time sequence.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>T1:</b> Start transaction (txid 200)</li>
<li><b>T2:</b> Start transaction (txid 201)</li>
<li><b>T3:</b> Execute SELECT commands of txid 200 and 201</li>
<li><b>T4:</b> Execute UPDATE command of txid 200</li>
<li><b>T5:</b> Execute SELECT commands of txid 200 and 201</li>
<li><b>T6:</b> Commit txid 200</li>
<li><b>T7:</b> Execute SELECT command of txid 201</li>
</ul>

<p>
To simplify the description,
assume that there are only two transactions, i.e. txid 200 and 201.
The isolation level of txid 200 is READ COMMITTED,
and the isolation level of txid 201 is either READ COMMITTED or REPEATABLE READ.
</p>

<p>
We explore how SELECT commands perform a visibility check for each tuple.
</p>

<p>
<b>SELECT commands of T3:</b>
</p>

<p>
At T3, there is an only Tuple_1 in the table <i>tbl</i> and it is <i>visible</i> by <b>Rule 6</b>;
thus, SELECT commands in both transactions return &#39;Jekyll&#39;.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Rule6(Tuple_1) ⇒ Status(t_xmin:199) = COMMITTED ∧ t_xmax = INVALID ⇒ Visible
</li>
</ul>

<div>
<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- txid 200
testdb=# SELECT * FROM tbl;
  name  
--------
 Jekyll
(1 row)
</pre>
</div>
<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- txid 201
testdb=# SELECT * FROM tbl;
  name  
--------
 Jekyll
(1 row)
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<b>SELECT commands of T5:</b>
</p>

<p>
First, we explore the SELECT command executed by txid 200.
Tuple_1 is invisible by <b>Rule 7</b> and Tuple_2 is visible by <b>Rule 2</b>;
thus, this SELECT command returns &#39;Hyde&#39;.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rule7(Tuple_1): Status(t_xmin:199) = COMMITTED ∧ Status(t_xmax:200) = IN_PROGRESS ∧ t_xmax:200 = current_txid:200 ⇒ Invisible
</li>

<li>Rule2(Tuple_2): Status(t_xmin:200) = IN_PROGRESS ∧ t_xmin:200 = current_txid:200 ∧ t_xmax = INVAILD ⇒ Visible
</li>
</ul>


<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- txid 200
testdb=# SELECT * FROM tbl;
 name 
------
 Hyde
(1 row)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, in the SELECT command executed by txid 201,
Tuple_1 is visible by <b>Rule 8</b> and Tuple_2 is invisible by <b>Rule 4</b>;
thus, this SELECT command returns &#39;Jekyll&#39;.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rule8(Tuple_1): Status(t_xmin:199) = COMMITTED ∧ Status(t_xmax:200) = IN_PROGRESS ∧ t_xmax:200 ≠ current_txid:201 ⇒ Visible
</li>
<li>Rule4(Tuple_2): Status(t_xmin:200) = IN_PROGRESS ∧ t_xmin:200 ≠ current_txid:201 ⇒ Invisible

</ul>

<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- txid 201
testdb=# SELECT * FROM tbl;

(1 row)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If the updated tuples are visible from other transactions before they are committed,
they are referred to as <b>Dirty Reads</b>,
also known as <b>wr-conflicts</b>.

However, as shown above, Dirty Reads do not occur in any isolation levels in PostgreSQL.



</p><p>
<b>SELECT command of T7:</b>
</p>

<p>
In the following, the behaviours of SELECT commands of T7 in both isolation levels are described.
</p>

<p>
First, we explore when txid 201 is in the READ COMMITTED level.
In this case, 
txid 200 is treated as COMMITTED because the transaction snapshot is <i>&#39;201:201:&#39;</i>.
Therefore, Tuple_1 is <i>invisible</i> by <b>Rule 10</b> and Tuple_2 is <i>visible</i> by <b>Rule 6</b>,
and the SELECT command returns &#39;Hyde&#39;.
</p>


<ul>
<li>Rule10(Tuple_1): Status(t_xmin:199) = COMMITTED ∧ Status(t_xmax:200) = COMMITTED ∧ Snapshot(t_xmax:200) ≠ active ⇒ Invisible
</li>

<li>Rule6(Tuple_2): Status(t_xmin:200) = COMMITTED ∧ t_xmax = INVALID ⇒ Visible
</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- txid 201 (READ COMMITTED)
testdb=# SELECT * FROM tbl;
 name 
------
 Hyde
(1 row)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note that the results of the SELECT commands,
which are executed before and after txid 200 is committed, differ.
This is generally known as <b>Non-Repeatable Reads</b>.
</p>

<p>
In contrast,
when txid 201 is in the REPEATABLE READ level,
txid 200 must be treated as IN_PROGRESS because the transaction snapshot is &#39;200:200:&#39;.

Therefore,
Tuple_1 is <i>visible</i> by <b>Rule 9</b> and Tuple_2 is <i>invisible</i> by <b>Rule 5</b>,
and the SELECT command returns &#39;Jekyll&#39;.

Note that Non-Repeatable Reads do not occur in the REPEATABLE READ (and SERIALIZABLE) level.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rule9(Tuple_1): Status(t_xmin:199) = COMMITTED ∧ Status(t_xmax:200) = COMMITTED ∧ Snapshot(t_xmax:200) = active ⇒ Visible
</li>

<li>Rule5(Tuple_2): Status(t_xmin:200) = COMMITTED ∧ Snapshot(t_xmin:200) = active  ⇒ Invisible
</li>
</ul>


<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- txid 201 (REPEATABLE READ)
testdb=# SELECT * FROM tbl;
  name  
--------
 Jekyll
(1 row)
</pre>
</div>

</div>


<br/>
<div>
  <p><i>  Hint Bits</i>
  </p>
  <div>
<p>
To obtain the status of a transaction,
PostgreSQL internally provides three functions, i.e., TransactionIdIsInProgress, TransactionIdDidCommit, and TransactionIdDidAbort.
These functions are implemented to reduce frequent access to the clog, such as caches.
However, bottlenecks will occur if they are executed whenever each tuple is checked.
</p>

<p>
To deal with this issue, PostgreSQL uses <i>hint bits</i>, which are shown in the following.
</p>

<pre>#define HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED       0x0100   /* t_xmin committed */
#define HEAP_XMIN_INVALID         0x0200   /* t_xmin invalid/aborted */
#define HEAP_XMAX_COMMITTED       0x0400   /* t_xmax committed */
#define HEAP_XMAX_INVALID         0x0800   /* t_xmax invalid/aborted */
</pre>



<p>
When reading or writing a tuple, PostgreSQL sets hint bits to the t_informask of the tuple if possible.
For example, assume that PostgreSQL checks the status of the t_xmin of a tuple and obtains the status COMMITTED.
In this case, PostgreSQL sets a hint bit HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED to the t_infomask of the tuple.
If hint bits are already set, TransactionIdDidCommit and TransactionIdDidAbort are no longer needed.
Therefore, PostgreSQL can efficiently check the statuses of both t_xmin and t_xmax of each tuple.
</p>

  </div>
 </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.7.2." name="_5.7.2."></a>5.7.2. Phantom Reads in PostgreSQL‘s REPEATABLE READ Level</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
REPEATABLE READ as defined in the ANSI SQL-92 standard allows <b>Phantom Reads</b>.
However, PostgreSQL&#39;s implementation does not allow them.
In principle, SI does not allow Phantom Reads.
</p>


<p>
Assume that two transactions, i.e. Tx_A and Tx_B, are running concurrently.
Their isolation levels are READ COMMITTED and REPEATABLE READ, and their txids are 100 and 101, respectively.
First, Tx_A inserts a tuple.
Then, it is committed.
The t_xmin of the inserted tuple is 100.

Next, Tx_B executes a SELECT command;
however, the tuple inserted by Tx_A is <i>invisible</i> by <b>Rule 5</b>.
Thus, Phantom Reads do not occur.

A <b>Lost Update</b>, also known as a <b>ww-conflict</b>,
is an anomaly that occurs when concurrent transactions update the same rows,

<li>
(8) If the target row has been updated by another concurrent transaction, proceed to step (9); otherwise, proceed to step (12).
</li>

<li>
(9) If the isolation level of this transaction is READ COMMITTED, proceed to step (10); otherwise, proceed to step (11).

</div>



<p>
This function performs update operations for each of the target rows.
It has a while loop to update each row,
and the inside of the while loop branches to three blocks according to the conditions shown in Fig. 5.11.
</p>

  </div>



<ul>
<li>[1] The target row is being updated (Fig. 5.11[1])</li>
<p>
&#39;Being updated&#39; means that the row is updated by another concurrent transaction and its transaction has not terminated.

In this case, the current transaction must wait for termination of the transaction that updated the target row
because PostgreSQL&#39;s SI uses the <b>first-updater-win</b> scheme.

For example, assume that transactions Tx_A and Tx_B run concurrently,
and Tx_B attempts to update a row;
however, Tx_A has updated it and is still in progress. 
In this case, Tx_B waits for the termination of Tx_A.
</p>

<p>
After the transaction that updated the target row commits, 
the update operation of the current transaction proceeds.

If the current transaction is in the READ COMMITTED level, the target row will be updated;
otherwise (REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE), the current transaction is aborted immediately to prevent lost updates.
</p>


<li>[2] The target row has been updated by the concurrent transaction (Fig. 5.11[2])</li>
<p>
The current transaction attempts to update the target tuple;
however, the other concurrent transaction has updated the target row and has already been committed.

In this case,
if the current transaction is in the READ COMMITTED level, the target row will be updated;
otherwise, the current transaction is aborted immediately to prevent lost updates.
</p>

<li>[3] There is no conflict (Fig. 5.11[3])</li>
<p>
When there is no conflict, the current transaction can update the target row.
</p>
</ul>

<div>
  <p><i>  first-updater-win / first-commiter-win</i>
  </p>
  <div><p>
As mentioned in this section, PostgreSQL&#39;s concurrency control based on SI uses the <i>first-updater-win</i> scheme to avoid lost update anomalies.
In contrast, as explained in the next section, PostgreSQL&#39;s SSI uses the <i>first-committer-win</i> scheme to avoid serialization anomalies.

<p><h3><a id="_5.8.2." name="_5.8.2."></a>5.8.2. Examples</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
Three examples are shown in the following.
The first and second examples show behaviours when the target row is being updated,
and the third example shows the behaviour when the target row has been updated.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<p>
Transactions Tx_A and Tx_B update the same row in the same table,
and their isolation level is READ COMMITTED.
</p>


<div>
<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- Tx_A

    ↓ 
    ↓ this transaction is being blocked
    ↓ 
UPDATE 1
</pre>
</div>
</div>



<p>
Tx_B is executed as follows.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
1) After executing the UPDATE command,
Tx_B should wait for the termination of Tx_A,
because the target tuple is being updated by Tx_A  (Step (4) in ExecUpdate).
</li>

<li>
2) After Tx_A is committed,
Tx_B attempts to update the target row (Step (7) in ExecUpdate).
</li>

<li>
3) In the second round of ExecUpdate,
the target row is updated again by Tx_B
(Steps (2),(8),(9),(10) in ExecUpdate).
</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<p>
Tx_A and Tx_B update the same row in the same table,
and their isolation levels are READ COMMITTED and REPEATABLE READ, respectively.
</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- Tx_A

    ↓ 
    ↓ this transaction is being blocked
    ↓

</pre>
</div>
</div>



<p>
The behaviour of Tx_B is described as follows.
</p>


<ul>
<li>
1)
After executing the UPDATE command, Tx_B should wait for the termination of Tx_A
(Step (4) in ExecUpdate).
</li>

<li>
2) After Tx_A is committed,
Tx_B is aborted to resolve conflict
because the target row has been updated and the isolation level of this transaction is REPEATABLE READ
(Steps (5) and (6) in ExecUpdate).
</li>

</ul>


<p><b>Example 3:</b></p>

<p>
Tx_B (REPEATABLE READ) attempts to update the target row that has been updated by the committed Tx_A.
In this case, Tx_B is aborted (Steps (2),(8),(9), and (11) in ExecUpdate).
</p>

<div>
<div>
<pre>testdb=# -- Tx_A

<p><h2><a id="_5.9." name="_5.9."></a>5.9. Serializable Snapshot Isolation</h2></p>
 <div>


<p>
Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI) has been embedded in SI since version 9.1 to realize a true SERIALIZABLE isolation level.
Since the explanation of SSI is not simple, only an outline is explained.
For details,
see <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql05.html#_5.ref.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the following, 
the technical terms shown in below are used without definitions.
If you are unfamiliar with these terms, see 
[<a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql05.html#_5.ref.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql05.html#_5.ref.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>].

<ul>
<li><i>precedence graph</i> (also known as <i>dependency graph</i> and <i>serialization graph)</i>
</li>
<li><i>serialization anomalies</i> (e.g. <i>Write-Skew)</i>
</li>
</ul>


  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.9.1." name="_5.9.1."></a>5.9.1. Basic Strategy for SSI Implementation</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
If a cycle that is generated with some conflicts is present in the precedence graph,
there will be a serialization anomaly.
This is explained using the simplest anomaly, i.e. Write-Skew.
</p>

<p>
Figure 5.12(1) shows a schedule.
Here, Transaction_A reads Tuple_B and Transaction_B reads Tuple_A. 
Then, Transaction_A writes Tuple_A and Transaction_B writes Tuple_B.

In this case, there are two rw-conflicts,
and they make a cycle in the precedence graph of this schedule, as shown in Fig. 5.12(2).
Thus, this schedule has a serialization anomaly, i.e. Write-Skew.
</p>


<p><b>Fig. 5.12. Write-Skew schedule and its precedence graph.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.12. Write-Skew schedule and its precedence graph." data-src="./img/fig-5-12.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>


<p>
Conceptually, there are three types of conflicts: wr-conflicts (Dirty Reads), ww-conflicts (Lost Updates), and rw-conflicts.
However, wr- and ww-conflicts do not need to be considered because,
as shown in the previous sections, PostgreSQL prevents such conflicts.
Thus, SSI implementation in PostgreSQL only needs to consider rw-conflicts.
</p>


<p>
PostgreSQL takes the following strategy for the SSI implementation:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Record all objects (tuples, pages, relations) accessed by transactions as SIREAD locks.</li>
<li>Detect rw-conflicts using SIREAD locks whenever any heap or index tuple is written.</li>
<li>Abort the transaction if a serialization anomaly is detected by checking detected rw-conflicts.</li>
</ol>



  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.9.2." name="_5.9.2."></a>5.9.2. Implementing SSI in PostgreSQL</h3></p>
 <div>


<p>
To realize the strategy described above,
PostgreSQL has implemented many functions and data structures.
However,
here we uses only two data structures: <b>SIREAD locks</b> and <b>rw-conflicts</b>, to describe the SSI mechanism.
They are stored in shared memory.
</p>


<br/>
<div><p>
For simplicity, some important data structures, such as SERIALIZABLEXACT, are omitted in this document.
Thus, the explanations of the functions, i.e. CheckTargetForConflictOut, CheckTargetForConflictIn, and PreCommit_CheckForSerializationFailure, are also extremely simplified.

For example, we indicate which functions detect conflicts;
however, how the conflicts are detected is not explained in detail.

If you want to know the details, refer to the source code: predicate.c. 
</p></div>
<br/>



<ul>
<li><b>SIREAD locks:</b></li>
<p>
An SIREAD lock, internally called a predicate lock, is a pair of an object and (virtual) txids
that store information about who has accessed which object.

Note that the description of virtual txid is omitted. txid is used rather than virtual txid to simplify the following explanation.
</p>

<p>
SIREAD locks are created by the CheckTargetForConflictsOut function whenever one DML command is executed in SERIALIZABLE mode.
For example, 
if txid 100 reads Tuple_1 of the given table,
an SIREAD lock {Tuple_1, {100}} is created.
If another transaction, e.g. txid 101, reads Tuple_1,
the SIREAD lock is updated to {Tuple_1, {100,101}}.

Note that a SIREAD lock is also created when an index page is read because an index page is only read without reading the table page when the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/indexes-index-only-scans.html" target="_blank">Index-Only Scans</a> feature, which is described in <a href="https://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql07.html#_7.2." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 7.2</a>, is applied.
</p>

<p>
SIREAD lock has three levels: tuple, page, and relation.

If the SIREAD locks of all tuples within a single page are created,
they are aggregated into a single SIREAD lock for that page,
and all SIREAD locks of the associated tuples are released (removed),
to reduce memory space.

The same is true for all pages that are read.
</p>

<p>
When creating an SIREAD lock for an index, the page level SIREAD lock is created from the beginning.
When using sequential scan, a relation level SIREAD lock is created from the beginning regardless of the presence of indexes and/or WHERE clauses.

Note that, in certain situations,
this implementation can cause false-positive detections of serialization anomalies.
The details are described in Section 5.9.4.
</p>


<li><b>rw-conflicts:</b></li>
<p>
A rw-conflict is a triplet of an SIREAD lock and two txids that reads and writes the SIREAD lock.
</p>

<p>
The CheckTargetForConflictsIn function is invoked  whenever either an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE command is executed in SERIALIZABLE mode,
and it creates rw-conflicts when detecting conflicts by checking SIREAD locks.
</p>

<p>
For example,
assume that txid 100 reads Tuple_1 and then txid 101 updates Tuple_1.

In this case, the CheckTargetForConflictsIn function, invoked by the UPDATE command in txid 101,
detects a rw-conflict with Tuple_1 between txid 100 and 101
then creates a rw-conflict {r=100, w=101, {Tuple_1}}.
</p>

</ul>

<p>
Both CheckTargetForConflictOut and CheckTargetForConflictIn functions, as well as the PreCommit_CheckForSerializationFailure function, which is invoked when the COMMIT command is executed in SERIALIZABLE mode, check serialization anomalies using the created rw-conflicts.

If they detect anomalies, only the first-committed transaction is committed and the other transactions are aborted
(by the <b>first-committer-win</b> scheme).
</p>


  </div>
<p><h3><a id="_5.9.3." name="_5.9.3."></a>5.9.3. How SSI Performs</h3></p>
 <div>
  <div>


<p>
Here, we describe how SSI resolves Write-Skew anomalies.
We use a simple table <i>tbl</i> shown below:
</p>

<pre>testdb=# CREATE TABLE tbl (id INT primary key, flag bool DEFAULT false);
testdb=# INSERT INTO tbl (id) SELECT generate_series(1,2000);
testdb=# ANALYZE tbl;
</pre>

<p>
Transactions Tx_A and Tx_B execute the following commands (Fig. 5.13).
</p>



<p><b>Fig. 5.13. Write-Skew scenario.</b></p><div>
<figure>
<img alt="Fig. 5.13. Write-Skew scenario." data-src="./img/fig-5-13.png" alt=""/>
</figure>
  </div>




<div>
<p>
Assume that all commands use index scan.
Therefore, when the commands are executed, 
they read both heap tuples and index pages,
each of which contains the index tuple that points to the corresponding heap tuple.
See Fig. 5.14.
</p>

</figure>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<ul>
<li><b>T1:</b>
Tx_A executes a SELECT command.
This command reads a heap tuple (Tuple_2000) and one page of the primary key (Pkey_2).
</li>

<li><b>T2:</b>
Tx_B executes a SELECT command.
This command reads a heap tuple (Tuple_1) and one page of the primary key (Pkey_1).
</li>

<li><b>T3:</b>
Tx_A executes an UPDATE command to update Tuple_1.
</li>

<li><b>T4:</b>
Tx_B executes an UPDATE command to update Tuple_2000.
</li>

<li><b>T5:</b>
Tx_A commits.
</li>

<li><b>T6:</b>
Tx_B commits; however, it is aborted due to a Write-Skew anomaly.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Figure 5.15 shows how PostgreSQL detects and resolves the Write-Skew anomaly described in the above scenario.
</p>

</figure>
  </div>




<ul>
<li><b>T1:</b></li>
<p>
When executing the SELECT command of Tx_A, CheckTargetForConflictsOut creates SIREAD locks.
In this scenario, the function creates two SIREAD locks: L1 and L2.
</p>
<p>
L1 and L2 are associated with Pkey_2 and Tuple_2000, respectively.
</p>

<li><b>T2:</b></li>
<p>
When executing the SELECT command of Tx_B,
CheckTargetForConflictsOut creates two SIREAD locks: L3 and L4.
</p>
<p>
L3 and L4 are associated with Pkey_1 and Tuple_1, respectively.
</p>

<li><b>T3:</b></li>
<p>
When executing the UPDATE command of Tx_A,
both CheckTargetForConflictsOut and CheckTargetForConflictsIN are invoked before and after ExecUpdate.
</p>

<p>
In this scenario, CheckTargetForConflictsOut does nothing.
</p>

<p>
CheckTargetForConflictsIn creates rw-conflict C1,
which is the conflict of both Pkey_1 and Tuple_1 between Tx_B and Tx_A,
because both Pkey_1 and Tuple_1 were read by Tx_B and written by Tx_A.
</p>


<li><b>T4:</b></li>

<p>
When executing the UPDATE command of Tx_B,
CheckTargetForConflictsIn creates rw-conflict C2,
which is the conflict of both Pkey_2 and Tuple_2000 between Tx_A and Tx_B.
</p>

<p>
In this scenario,
C1 and C2 create a cycle in the precedence graph;
thus, Tx_A and Tx_B are in a non-serializable state.

However, both transactions Tx_A and Tx_B have not been committed,
therefore CheckTargetForConflictsIn does not abort Tx_B.

Note that this occurs because PostgreSQL&#39;s SSI implementation is based on the <i>first-committer-win</i> scheme.
</p>


<li><b>T5:</b></li>

<p>
When Tx_A attempts to commit, PreCommit_CheckForSerializationFailure is invoked.
This function can detect serialization anomalies
and can execute a commit action if possible.

In this scenario,
Tx_A is committed because Tx_B is still in progress.
</p>


<li><b>T6:</b></li>
<p>
When Tx_B attempts to commit, 
PreCommit_CheckForSerializationFailure detects a serialization anomaly
and Tx_A has already been committed; thus, Tx_B is aborted.
</p>

</ul>

<p>
In addition,
if the UPDATE command is executed by Tx_B after Tx_A has been committed (at <b>T5</b>),
Tx_B is immediately aborted
because CheckTargetForConflictsIn invoked by Tx_B&#39;s UPDATE command detects a serialization anomaly (Fig. 5.16(1)).
</p>

<p>
If the SELECT command is executed instead of COMMIT at <b>T6</b>,
Tx_B is immediately aborted
because CheckTargetForConflictsOut invoked by Tx_B&#39;s SELECT command detects a serialization anomaly (Fig. 5.16(2)).
</p>
