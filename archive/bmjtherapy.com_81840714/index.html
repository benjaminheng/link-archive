Had a badly injured ankle and she guided me patiently with exercises and drills to get back to 100%. She&#39;s very friendly and warm-hearted which made the sessions fun and kept me optimistic despite the pain that comes with the physiotherapy. Hope I don&#39;t need physiotherapy again, but if I get injured again, I&#39;d be comfortable returning here. Highly recommended!				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1578398335_124.jpg" alt="Darryl Avatar"/></span></p>

					<span><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></span>I was bringing my parents to see Vanessa last week. My father was having a neck problem, he cant  turn his head and had a scan done few months before showing that he has bone problems. After meeting Vanessa, she find out that actually it is not bone problem, it is just a stiff muscle that made him cant turn his head on his own ( but can be turned with Vanessa&#39;s help), so only with 2 sessions He can turn his head freely now.. My mom is also the same.. my mom taught that she might have bone problems and would like to do mri scan on her hips.. since she was in pain when walking.. after meeting Vanessa,  also the same, just stiff muscle and it is much better after Vanessa did the massage. And now she can walk painfree. Thank you Vanessa for solving my parents problem and also save us a lot of money (no need to do mri scan for my mom).. will definitely see you again when we go to singapore.				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1567209600_87.jpg" alt="Pinta Ongko Avatar"/></span></p>

					<span><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></span>Cherie Tan has helped me to recover from my shoulder injury (rotator cuff) and I can now get back to the badminton court with full strength. She is very knowledgeable and tailored the treatment and exercises that I need to do based on my feedback and recovery process in each review session with her. In addition, she took the extra miles to explain the purpose of each exercise and how it helps in the healing so that I can understand it better and know how to prevent it in the future.				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1559260800_95.jpg" alt="Chee Yih Wan Avatar"/></span></p>

During my post-ops ACL reconstruction, she has explained well in my physio sessions by providing tailored advices to what are the possible areas lacking which I could improve on. Taping and self massage techniques were also taught.</p><p>

Her positive attitude encourages me to keep on trying and never give up. Very appreciative of her for making constant effort to understand my sport and my concerns during my returning to sport phase.				</p></div><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1562649856_3.jpg" alt="Lee guo ying Avatar"/></span></p>

					<span><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></span>Due to Osteoarthritis, I have a compacted right hip joint; as such, my right thigh movement was restricted for many months. Through two physiotherapy sessions, the physiotherapist at BMJ physiotherapy has enabled me to move my right thigh much more easily. The range of movements has increased tremendously; I can now position my right thigh for the stretching pose, when I previously could not. In fact, my right thigh can move to an obtuse angle when it previously could not. It feels a lot more limber! This is amazing! I am really thankful to the physiotherapist for that.				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1580463062_126.jpg" alt="Jason Loh Avatar"/></span></p>

					<span><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></span>I’ve been visiting Darek at East Coast BMJ consistently on a weekly / now bi-weekly basis for the past 1.5 years after going through a back surgery in Feb 2018 and the experience has simply been the best. I’ve visited numerous physiotherapists before my surgery but it was not very helpful. Darek is passionate about alleviating pain using mainly handwork and a variety of other methods such as stretches &amp; exercise. His handwork is pretty amazing compared to my past experience and the techniques that he uses changes as he upgrades himself through continual learning from workshops, further learning etc.				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1571184000_38.jpg" alt="Shawn Chin Avatar"/></span></p>

I’ve visited numerous physiotherapists before my surgery but it was not very helpful. Darek is passionate about alleviating pain using mainly handwork and a variety of other methods such as stretches &amp; exercise. His handwork is pretty amazing compared to my past experience and the techniques that he uses changes as he upgrades himself through continual learning from workshops, further learning etc.				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1571270400_82.jpg" alt="Shawn Chin Avatar"/></span></p>

He listens to your problems and gives you easy and effective exercises to fix them. I particularly like the fact that Derek makes no assumptions and has a very close look at the problem area before deciding what to do about it. Many physios will just assume you have the same problems they see every day. If you have an old injury or pain that you think cannot be fixed, please give BMJ a try. You won’t regret it.				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1543536000_58.jpg" alt="Jamie O&#39;Brien Avatar"/></span></p>

I thought my pain and issue would never go away but I&#39;m so thankful that I&#39;m on the road to recovery and pain free now. I&#39;ve recommended BMJ to my family and they all have nothing but good things to say. Kudos to Siti for her friendliness excellent customer service too! Keep it up! :)				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1567123200_43.jpg" alt="Vanessa Charmaine Seah Avatar"/></span></p><div><p>Vanessa Charmaine Seah</p><p>8/30/2019</p> </div>

I can&#39;t do bench press, snatch, and overhead squat, it even affected my hydrodynamic when I was doing freediving. Within 7 sessions, the physiotherapist located and solved my problem; now, I am pain-free and have more tools and knowledge to keep improving my flexibility and sports performance. As such, I highly recommend anyone who suffers from any sports injury to seek help from BMJ.				</p><p><span><img src="https://bmjtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/wprevslider/avatars/1559260800_94.jpg" alt="Vincent Lin Avatar"/></span></p>
