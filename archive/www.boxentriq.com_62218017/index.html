        <h2 id="classic-ciphers">Classic Ciphers</h2>
        <p>
            In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is a method for protecting data through encryption and decryption. Most ciphers require a specific
            key for encryption and decryption, but some ciphers like the ROT13 or Atbash ciphers have fixed keys. Many of the ciphers listed here were
            for military or other significant use during an earlier time, but today mostly are used only by puzzle makers.

        <p>
            Wordplay and witty texts is one of the oldest forms of puzzles. Anagrams have been traced to the time of the Ancient Greeks, and they still
            are popular in modern brain teasers. Synonyms are common not only in crosswords, but plays a role in a wider range of puzzles. This section also
            contains text processing tools, which are useful for reversing, changing case, etc of texts.

        <h2 id="modern-ciphers">Modern Ciphers</h2>
        <p>
            Modern encryption methods can be divided by the key type and their operation on input data. Symmetric key algorithms use the same key
            for encryption and decryption (private key cryptography). Asymmetric key algorithms use different keys for encryption and decryption
            (public key cryptography). With symmetric keys, the sender and receiver must have agreed upon a key in advance, while with asymmetric keys
            anyone can send messages to the receiver. Also depending on their operation, ciphers are either block ciphers (encrypting a fixed block size)
            or stream ciphers (encrypting a continuous stream of data).

        <h2 id="steganography">Steganography</h2>
        <p>
            While encryption protects information from being understood, an even higher protection would be if the information
            is hidden. The word steganography comes from the Greek word &#34;steganos&#34;, meaning concealed, and &#34;graphein&#34;, meaning writing.
            Modern steganography can hide information in images and audio files. Also information can be manually hidden in
            images through the use of very low contrast colors or metadata.

        <h2 id="encodings">Encodings</h2>
        <p>
            Computers and digital devices need to represent letters in appropriate ways. ASCII codes are very common for storing texts, but with the
            demand to support more non-English texts, the popularity of Unicode is increasing. Hashes are not encodings, but since they are more or less
            unique for all words, they can be considered like encodings (although much more difficult to reverse).

        <h2 id="math">Math</h2>
        <p>
            Mathematics play an important role in logic puzzles and code-breaking. It is important to be able to
            convert between different number systems, and detect special properties of numbers such as that they are
            prime numbers. Also number sequences, like the Fibonacci sequence, are commonly used in puzzles.

        <h2 id="alphabets">Alphabets</h2>
        <p>
            Every alphabet has a number of symbols that are the building blocks of the specific language. In addition to
            traditional written languages, alphabets have evolved for telegraphy (Morse code), visually impaired people
            (Braille) and maritime signal flags. Further alphabets have evolved in popular culture, such as the Klingon
            alphabet (from Star Trek) or dancing men code (from Sherlock Holmes).

        <h3>You can&#39;t rely on tools only</h3>
        <p>
            Although tools can be helpful, there&#39;s a saying: &#34;A fool with a tool is still only a fool&#34;.
            Good quality code-breaking puzzles can&#39;t be solved simply by using tools. It&#39;s your wits and creativity that matter,
            and the tools are just there to help explore your ideas.
