			<p>I’ve done <a href="https://github.com/kognise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a lot of things with computers</a>, but I’ve always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap — I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I’ve used syscalls, but how do they <em>work</em>? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?</p><p><img src="https://cpu.land/images/writing-this-article.png" loading="eager" alt="A scrawled digital drawing.

There aren’t many comprehensive systems resources if you aren’t going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would’ve killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I’m writing the article that I wished I had.</p><p>And you know what they say… you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else.</p><blockquote><p>In a hurry? Feel like you know this stuff already?</p><p><a href="https://cpu.land/how-to-run-a-program">Read chapter 3</a> and I guarantee you will learn something new. Unless you’re like, Linus Torvalds himself.</p></blockquote>
