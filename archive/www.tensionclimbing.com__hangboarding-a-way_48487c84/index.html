	<p><span>I find that these grips are the most effective use of hangboard time. The adaptations are more general and applicable than more specialized grip types. Specialized grip types are better addressed on the wall.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Yes, I put full crimp in that list. If you are going to use it, you should feel comfortable training it. Don&#39;t go crazy though, it is one of the most injury prone grip positions. I usually recommend hangboarding without the thumb wrap in favor of loading the first finger more. Then using the thumb wrap when climbing. Be extremely conservative with volume and intensity. Build up slowly and keep an eye on how your fingers feel every session. Any lingering pain or discomfort is an immediate stop sign (same goes for any grip).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>A contentious issue these days is edge size. I don’t actually find the specific edge size that important at all, as long as it is consistent. For the most part, you want an edge that is about the size of your fingertip or less. It should also be as comfortable as possible while still being usable. As an edge gets smaller, it becomes more difficult to hang on to and it must inherently become “sharper” on its edge in order to remain usable. Smaller, sharper edges are more condition dependent and tax the skin more. In specific circumstances it is productive to increase intensity by hanging smaller edges (&lt;15mm), but for the most part, it is both pragmatic and effective to train on a larger edge (~15-20mm) and modify the load by adding or subtracting weight from your body.</span></p>
<p><span>There are multiple paths for adaptation that we can leverage to increase finger strength. Structural adaptations increase muscle cross sectional area and alter the properties of the connective tissue to increase force production and transfer. Neuromuscular adaptations alter how muscle fibers and the nervous system interact, allowing the muscle to deliver a higher percentage of the strength potential it already possess. Structural adaptations occur more slowly than neuromuscular adaptations, but increases in structural adaptation last longer and require less frequent “upkeep” than neuromuscular adaptations. Metabolic adaptations change the way the muscles store, produce, and use energy. All of these types of adaptation are important and to some extent, all are affected by hangboard training.</span></p>
<p><span>These different adaptations can be brought about by different loading methodologies. Connective tissue reacts productively to both high intensity and high density work. Neuromuscular adaptations are usually the result of using high loads at maximum effort. Working with lower loads for longer durations and/or multiple repetitions to failure/near failure helps promote an increase in muscle cross sectional area. Metabolic adaptations happen across the spectrum, but to keep it simple: Short bouts of high intensity loading with near full recovery in between causes the muscle to store more energy for immediate use, increasing the capacity for power output, but fatigue happens more quickly and full recovery takes more time. Longer bouts of sub maximal loading with more repetitions and less rest causes the muscle to fatigue more slowly and recover more quickly, though it has less capacity for short duration/high power output. These can all be good things depending on your goals, so the idea that one particular type of adaptation is inherently better than another is misguided. </span></p>

<p><span>When looking at how to work hangboarding into your training schedule on a large scale it is usually a good idea to focus more on structural adaptation phases throughout the year and shift focus to phases of neuromuscular and/or metabolic adaptation at strategic points to prepare for trips or other specific goals. That doesn’t mean you can/should only work on one thing at a time. You can address multiple adaptations at the same time, but the more things you try to improve, the less you can improve in each. The more you focus, the more you can improve. It is also important to keep in mind that the more experienced you are the more you have to focus on single avenues of adaptation to see significant improvements. Generally the idea is to alternate the focus of phases between structural (building the muscle) and neuromuscular (teaching the muscle) adaptations.</span></p>
<p><span>The amount of time you spend in a hangboard “phase” depends on the type of adaptation you’re focusing on. A phase focusing on structural changes could last as long as 10-20 workouts, while a phase focusing on neuromuscular changes could be as short as 6-10 workouts. You&#39;ll notice towards the end of your phase that your improvement across workouts will start to level off. This is normal. If you are still making significant improvement across workouts, you can keep going, but once you hit that area of diminishing returns... it&#39;s time to rest and switch it up. People seem to get this confused and often think they should not climb, train, or do anything at all during these “rest” phases. This is incorrect. During a rest phase, it is important to continue to climb and give periodic high intensity effort. The “resting” is simply reducing overall volume, frequency, and intensity to allow your body to repair and recover from the demands of the previous training phase. Actually taking 2 weeks entirely off of climbing every time you finish a training phase is counter productive. If you were training 5 days a week during the training phase, climbing 2-3 days a week and resting 4-5 days a week would be a “rest”. That being said, taking a few longer complete rest phases per year IS beneficial and important. </span></p>
<p><span>How a hangboard phase looks is specific to the type of adaptation you are focusing on. For a structural phase, I usually like to perform 2-3 structural workouts for every 0-1 neuromuscular workout. When in a neuromuscular phase, I either completely eliminate the structural workouts or do 1 structural workout for every 2-3 neuromuscular workouts. When planning this out, keep in mind that different workouts require different amounts of rest to recover from in order to have another productive workout. This is really the main information you need when deciding on the actual schedule of your workouts and overall training plan. This applies to hangboarding and anything else you’re doing for training. Ideally, you train every time you are appropriately recovered from the previous training. Sometimes you want to create a cumulative fatigue across workouts, sometimes you want to fully recover between workouts, most of the time, it is a mixture. For structural adaptations, I like to build some cumulative fatigue across a few workouts, allow for a more complete recovery, then repeat. For neuromuscular adaptations, it is important to be relatively recovered before each workout. This typically means that during phases where you are focusing on structural adaptations, the overall volume of hangboarding is higher, but the load is a lower percentage of your max. It is okay to have 2-3 workouts that compound on one another, but then you need to let yourself recover more fully before the next bout of 2-3 workouts. If you notice that your hangboard numbers are getting progressively worse over 2-3 mini cycles of  2-3 workouts, your work:recovery ratio is off balance and you need to do less work and/or increase your ability to recover. When focusing on neuromuscular adaptations, the volume of hangboarding goes way down, but the load goes way up, and the main thing you have to keep an eye on is how frequently you are actually able to have a quality hangboard session. You don’t want that frequency to drop to less than once every 10 days, every 4-6 days being a good window to shoot for. I find that it is often better to rest in preparation for a better workout than to force yourself to complete a sub-par workout just because it is on the schedule.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><span>A quick aside about “recovery”. The 3 most important things you can do to recover are: hydrate, eat, and sleep. If you aren’t doing these three things as well as you can, stop wasting your time and/or money sitting in ice baths, strapping yourself into compression systems, shooting yourself with lasers, scraping at “adhesions”, stabbing yourself with needles, etc. In the immortal words of Samuel L. Jackson: “Go the f*ck to sleep!”. If fact, not sleeping well is one of the main reasons I’ll postpone or cancel a hangboard workout or even whole climbing session for myself. Anyway, back to hangboarding...</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>The whole time you are in a hangboarding phase of any type, you are </span><b>also climbing! </b><span>Getting stronger is essentially worthless if you aren’t also learning to apply it. Trying to just get super strong and then learn how to use it later is not a good idea. I’ve made this mistake myself on numerous occasions (...and still do). Climbing concurrently during hangboarding phases is also important because you need the stimulus that climbing provides, both the volume, and the novel/specific grip positions. Whether or not you climb and hangboard on the same day is more a value judgement than a safety judgement. Sometimes it makes sense within your schedule and sometimes it doesn’t. Yes, you should be smart about it, but you can absolutely hangboard and climb on the same day. </span></p>
<p><span>Not only should you be climbing, but you should be thinking about how your hangboarding and climbing stimuli are going to interact: If you’re planning on doing a neuromuscular hangboard workout tomorrow, it may not be a good idea to climb on limit finger intensive boulders today. If you just did a hard hangboard workout and are climbing afterwards, it may be a good idea to make sure you are targeting some of the grip types that you weren’t just working on the hangboard (pinches, slopers, etc.). Not that there are any rules etched in stone, but the more effectively you understand how all of the different things you are doing are compounding and interacting, the more effective your training will be. </span></p>
<p><span>Yes, it is a lot to keep track of, but failing to do so is to be on the fast-track to injury and/or underperformance. Some people have a knack for feeling this out and instinctively strike an effective balance. Most people don’t. The best way to learn how to do this is to WRITE IT DOWN. Do your best to come up with some sort of loose plan for a single training phase, then record what you do every day and adapt based on how things feel. At the end of the phase, go back over what you wrote down and see what seemed to work well and what didn’t. Make a new plan and repeat. That’s it. The only catch is, you have to actually do it for it to work, but the more you do it, the better it works. </span></p>
</div><div id="panel-6315-7-0-4" data-index="21">
	<p><span>Let’s get into some specific workouts. Which, honestly, aren’t nearly as important as understanding everything previous to this. I mention “failure” quite a bit in the protocols below, so it is probably best to clarify what I mean when I say “failure”. Failure in this context is when you can no longer maintain the proper form in regards to grip position, shoulder engagement, etc. If you’re actually pushing to the point that you explode violently off the board, you’ve gone way too far. Pushing yourself to that point isn’t going to make you any stronger, but it will put you at a higher risk for injury.</span></p>
<p><span>As I’ve tried to say multiple times, there are many different protocols that are effective. Listed below are some of the main methods I use and tweak as needed (the names are not creative):</span></p>
<hr/>
<h3><span>6 and 10</span></h3>
<p><span>This is my workhorse workout. I use this more than any other throughout the year. It is mostly tailored for structural adaptations, but it exists somewhere towards the middle of the spectrum.</span></p>

<p><span>- 6 seconds on : 10 seconds off x 5 repetitions. ~2-3min between sets.</span></p>
<p><span>- I program this for 4-6 sets. Each set is dedicated to a single grip type. I usually perform half of the sets in half crimp and the other half in open crimp. If there is a special grip type that need to be trained for a certain goal (full crimp, pocket pair, 3 finger drag, etc.) I trade in two of the open crimp and/or half crimp sets to make room for two of the special grip sets.</span></p>
<p><span>- The goal here is to apply a load to each set so by the 5th repetition you are right up to the point of failure, but don’t actually fail. If you were theoretically try to perform a 6th repetition, you would fail. </span></p>
<p><span>- I like to modify the intensity in 2.5-5 pound increments. With this protocol, I like to be conservative and would rather lean towards a workout being a touch too easy rather than making it too hard and failing on or before the 5th repetition. </span></p>
<hr/>
<h3><span>6:6x6+</span></h3>
<p><span>This is a structural/metabolic workout that I use when I am the farthest away from a performance bouldering phase, so typically right after I return from a trip. I find that it helps me build the work capacity and general foundation that I need to build the rest of my phases off of. I will also use it “in-season” if I am going to be doing long boulders or bouldery sport climbs and feel like I need it.</span></p>

<p><span>- 6 seconds on : 6 seconds off x 6+ repetitions to form failure. 2min between sets.</span></p>
<p><span>- I program this for 4-6 sets. Each set is dedicated to a single grip type. I usually perform half of the sets in half crimp and the other half in open crimp. If there is a special grip type that need to be trained for a certain goal (full crimp, pocket pair, 3 finger drag, etc.) I trade in two of the open crimp and/or half crimp sets to make room for two of the special grip sets.</span></p>
<p><span>- This is a particularly versatile one and the goal here is to pick a rep range within which you will fail to complete a hang. Once you can hit the upper end of the rep range, you increase the load by the smallest amount that gets you back to failing at the bottom of the rep range and work back up. For number of repetitions, I like 5-8, but that’s on the low end and you could definitely go to 8-10 or 10-12 no problem, you’ll just be working with a lower load the longer you go. If you are using this in season to maintain finger strength endurance, higher rep ranges are going to be more route climbing specific and lower rep ranges are usually going to be more specific to bouldering.</span></p>
<p><span>- The on:off interval and the number of repetitions are very flexible. For on:off, I like 6:6, but you could push it to 7:3; 10:5; whatever. The point is to expose yourself to a cumulative fatigue that ultimately results in failure. A good rule here is to just keep the “off” time equal to or lower than the “on” time. </span></p>
<hr/>
<h3><span>Single Hangs</span></h3>
<p><span>This is primarily a neuromuscular workout that also does some good things for the connective tissue. Leading up to a performance phase, I’ll program this so I don’t fail on the hangs, but leave about a 2-3 second buffer to failure. In season or immediately before a trip, I’ll actually go to the point of failure. This isn’t something I usually recommend to people until they have been climbing regularly for a few years and have also done a few cycles of “repeater” style workouts (like the ones above), but do as you will.</span></p>

<p><span>- 6 seconds on : 2-4 minutes off.</span></p>
<p><span>- I program this for 4-8 hangs. I usually perform half of the hangs in half crimp and the other half in open crimp. If there is a special grip type that need to be trained for a certain goal (full crimp, pocket pair, 3 finger drag, etc.) I trade in two of the open crimp and/or half crimp hangs to make room for two of the special grip hangs.</span></p>
<p><span>- 6 seconds for the hang is a flexible guideline. If you prefer 4 second or 8 seconds, whatever. As long as it is consistent and not too long, you’re good to go. I typically think of 10 seconds as the longest amount of time you’d want to hang for a workout like this, but I tend towards the 4-8 second range in favor of using a higher load. </span></p>
<hr/>
<h3><span>Long Hangs</span></h3>
<p><span>These are something I’ve had good results with, but it seems to take a long time to respond to it so it can be difficult to schedule well. It also falls under the structural adaptation umbrella and is good for the connective tissue. I try to use this similarly to the 666+ workout to build a foundation early on and away from peak performance phases. Though it is also useful alongside the single hangs as an “in-season” maintenance workout.</span></p>

<p><span>- 15-30 seconds on : 2-4 minutes off.</span></p>
<p><span>- I program this for 3-5 hangs, usually in open crimp or half crimp, but this is also a great way to build resiliency in specific grips like pocket pairs.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Each hang is until failure. I usually choose a load that has me fail in 15-20 seconds, but you could certainly adjust the load in order to fail closer to 30 seconds.</span></li>
</ul>
<hr/>

</div><div id="panel-6315-7-0-5" data-index="22">
	<p><span>Lastly, I’d like to address different hanging postures. The questions are usually: one handed (unilateral) hangs vs. two handed hangs (bilateral) -and- straight arms vs. bent arms.</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to unilateral vs. bilateral hangs, The answer is normally, “which is most pragmatic?” If you are strong enough that you are adding close to your bodyweight on bilateral hangs, it is typically easier to perform unilateral hangs and subtract a small increment of weight rather than figure out a way to strap a large percentage of your bodyweight onto yourself. Biomechanically, two important things that change between bilateral and unilateral hangs are shoulder and wrist position. Hanging from one arm is more stressful on the shoulder. If you feel like you are failing on unilateral hangs because your shoulder is too weak, do bilateral hangs and sort out the shoulder weakness separately. The wrist position change between unilateral and bilateral hangs is the thing that interests me most. Wrist position and grip strength are inextricably linked. Strength differences between unilateral and bilateral hangs seem to be mostly due to this. The more experienced you get and the harder you climb, the more specific the unilateral hang position becomes. For most people it isn’t worth worrying about. Even the people for whom it might be worthwhile to worry about...it’s usually not that important. Either way, using the pragmatic argument usually sorts those populations out without having to get into the more esoteric wrist position argument. </span></p>
<p><span>Straight arm hangs and bent arm hangs also have wrist and shoulder components involved. Your grip is mechanically stronger with wrist extension and ulnar deviation. Hanging with bent arms allows you to leverage this position more effectively. However, you need to have the requisite strength to maintain that bent arm position in order to use it. Some people do, some people don’t. If you don’t have the strength, get it, but it is probably not a great idea to try to get it on the hangboard. Train the arm on the bar and the fingers on the hangboard. If you do have the requisite strength, hangboarding in a slightly locked off position is a good way to maintain that strength while also effectively training finger strength. When you are hanging with bent arm(s) it is natural for your shoulder to be well engaged. However, with straight arm hangs, it is easier to allow yourself to hang passively on the shoulder joint. This is a huge no-no. If you can’t keep your shoulders active and engaged while hangboarding, you shouldn’t be hangboarding (and you should be very careful while climbing). Simple as that. Train your shoulders first. Once you have the requisite shoulder control, you can revisit the hangboard.</span></p>

<p><span>In closing, if you learn to think critically about how different hangboard protocols (and different training modalities in general) work and how they can complement the rest of your climbing, you create a situation where your training can adapt to changing goals and circumstances. The better you can adapt your training to changing conditions on the fly, the more effective your training will be. </span></p>
