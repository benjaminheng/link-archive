    Good morning,<br/>I was told that I may find better support by asking the public forum about several questions on non-topmount LDPump setups. Many thanks to any participants!
  </p><p>
    I am looking for your expert opinions on an LDPump Setup that can handle common road terrains including paved roads and sidewalk. However, I have high interest in also bringing the board in rough terrain such as uphills, cemented gravel, and brick roads.
  </p><p>
    I am new to LDPump, but have experience in LDPush, switch push, and uphill surf-skating. Ideally, my budget is within the $800 mark, but can be convinced to purchase items as necessary.<br/>May I seek your expert opinions of the following questions?
  </p><ol>
      <li>
    <p>
    I’ve seen the analogy that surfskate is like the lowest gear in the bicycle, bracket systems are like mid gears, and torsion tails are like high gears. Is that a fairly accurate analogy?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    What speed range and environments does the bracket systems excel at compared to the torsion tails?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    I am unfamiliar with the differences and feels of the rear DT poppy rear VS DT delerium rear VS TTX, what situation would each rear truck system be best used for?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    What would be your recommended setup for a gold standard LDPump to handle all terrain, while going as fast as budget-conscious possible on fair terrain? I am not afraid to push, but would like to pump through as much terrain if motion economy is efficient enough; goal is to not pickup board on most terrain and inclines encountered.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    What size board and wheelbase should I purchase? I am interested in the Pantheon JM Bandito, for the portability, design, graphic, and price of the board, but open to suggestions or comments about choices.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Does board size matter for LDPump? I see people with X24, X26, X27, X28, and 34” topmounts, but everyones stance seems to use only a small portion of the board which is why I assume I may be able to get away with the Pantheon JM Bandito since its 23.3” if I use the front foot stop and place rear foot at edge’s end.
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    What is your current non-topmount LDPump setup and do you recommend it? What what terrains can you challenge? What speeds can you achieve in a common manner?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    I am unfamiliar with bracket or torsion tail maintenance and durability, would you have any comments about both or either?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    I am unfamiliar with wedging/dewedging angles, any recommendations for a beginner? Once I have many hours on the beginner angles, what angles would you recommend for an intermediate/enthusiast rider?
  </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
    Below is my theorized setup, any comments or recommendations would be awesome.<br/>- PURPOSE: Long distance, 85% Pump // 15% Push, all terrain, uphills, semi-budget conscious ($800)<br/>- BOARD: Pantheon JM Bandito 23.3” length (-$140)<br/>- 2x BRACKET (-$260) or 1x BRACKET &amp; 1x TTX (-$430)<br/>- TRUCKS: 45* DT Poppys (as directed by Bandito Board) (-$170)<br/>- BEARINGS: Zealous (-$15)<br/>- WHEELS: Caguma 85mm 80a (unsure if Seismic SV make that much of a difference for addn&#39;l $20) (-$80)<br/>- BUSHINGS: No idea (I have extra Otang Nipples in 85a orange and 87a purple, to start with)

    Many thanks for your time and effort to respond, greatly appreciate it!
