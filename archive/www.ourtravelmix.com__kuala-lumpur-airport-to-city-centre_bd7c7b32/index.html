GRAB is one of our favourite <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ourtravelmix.com/the-20-best-trip-planning-apps-for-travellers-in-2019/" target="_blank">travel apps</a>, especially in Southeast Asia.  <br/></p><p>If you are staying in KLCC, Kuala Lumpur City Centre, you can take the LRT on the Kelana Jaya Line from KL Sentral to KLCC which will take around 15 additional minutes.<br/></p><p>Also, bear in mind that the bus is impacted by traffic.  You may experience delays during peak times, so don’t choose this option if you have somewhere to be.<br/></p><p>The buses are very comfortable with air-conditioning, baggage compartments, and reclining seats.<br/></p><p>There are three bus companies running to KL Sentral, and one that goes to Pudu Sentral in Chinatown.  All four are fine to take, they are reliable, depart frequently, and cost around the same price.<br/></p><p><strong>Airport Coach</strong></p><p>The Airport Coach runs at 30-minute intervals, only from KLIA to KL Sentral.  This bus costs slightly more than the ones departing from KLIA 2, at RM15.<br/></p><p><strong>Aerobus</strong></p><p>Aerobus runs from KLIA2 to KL Sentral and costs RM12.<br/></p><p><strong>SkyBus</strong></p><p>SkyBus departs every 15 minutes during peak times and 30 minutes during non-peak times.  It only departs from KLIA2 and costs RM11.<br/></p><p><strong>Star Shuttle Express</strong></p><p>This is our preferred KL Airport bus service.  It runs every 30 minutes, departing from both KLIA and KLIA 2.  It is the only bus service to go from Kuala Lumpur airport to Pudu Sentral (near Chinatown).  It also offers a service to KL Sentral.  The Star Shuttle costs RM12.<br/></p><p>This is the easiest option as it is affordable, goes from both terminals, and arrives in either Pudu Sentral or KL Sentral.  </p><h3>Kuala Lumpur Airport Bus Cost</h3><p>The bus to and from KL Sentral costs RM12, or $3 USD, each way and is the cheapest way to get to the city centre from Kuala Lumpur Airport.  There is also a bus to and from Pudu Sentral, in Chinatown, which also costs RM12. Chinatown is one of the best <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ourtravelmix.com/things-to-do-in-kl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things to do in Kuala Lumpur</a>, so heading here straight from the airport could be a great way to start your trip in KL.</p><h3>Where to Catch the Kuala Lumpur Airport Bus</h3><p>You can catch the KL Airport bus from the bus terminal after purchasing your tickets at the bus ticketing booths.  <br/></p><p>Follow the signs to find the ticketing booths, where you will be able to purchase your ticket.  The signs usually say “bas”, which is the Malay word for bus.  The staff at the booth should speak reasonable English, just let them know where you are heading and they will give you the correct ticket.<br/></p><p>They will not rip you off as the prices are fixed.<br/></p><p>Once you have your ticket, you’ll be able to head right outside and wait for your bus at the gate specified on your ticket – again, this is all clearly signposted.<br/></p><p>The bus will depart and take you directly to the destination – either Pudu Sentral or KL Sentral – with no stops along the way.<br/></p><p><strong>KLIA </strong></p><p>Book tickets and catch the bus from the Transportation Hub on the Ground floor.  This is around a 3-minute walk from the Arrivals Terminal.<br/></p><p><strong>KLIA2</strong></p><p>Book tickets and catch the bus from the bus terminal at Level 1.  </p><h2><span id="Kuala_Lumpur_Airport_Train"></span>Kuala Lumpur Airport Train<span></span></h2><p>There are two trains departing from Kuala Lumpur Airport: the KLIA Express and the KLIA Transit.  The KLIA Express is the best option as it travels from Both KLIA and KLIA 2 directly to KL Sentral.<br/></p><p>The KLIA Transit train stops along the way at Salak Tinggi, Putrajaya, Bandar Tasik and Selatan.  This is convenient if you are staying at any of these locations, but most travellers will be heading to the city centre.<br/></p><p>The KLIA Express train takes 28 minutes from KLIA to KL Sentral or 33 minutes from KLIA2 to KL Sentral, making it by far the fastest transport option for getting into the city.  On top of this, they are equipped with 4G WiFi.<br/></p><p>The KLIA Express operates every 15 minutes during peak times, or every 20 minutes during non-peak and on Saturdays.<br/></p><p>However, unless your accommodation is near KL Sentral, you will need to try different transport options to take you to your door.  To KLCC, you can take the LRT from KL Sentral to KLCC on the Kelana Jaya Line.  Alternatively, Grab is a great way to get around within the city centre.<br/></p><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_T7GCixCWQKPbXk7pY6TdR7VpYjLJX7zKivy4fLbM4AieQgVsD5UrBqNDzKRWU9INHUYtuAQMd7qYBcKNJlbbMdfrUfFGd1k5Tqt38l2J1oCdVXuiLcl-1NK8_MLIhZN8xcswiW8" alt="Train in Kuala Lumpur."/></figure><p><strong>Kuala Lumpur Airport Train Cost</strong><br/></p><p>The Kuala Lumpur Airport train costs RM55, or $13 USD, one-way to get from KLIA or KLIA2 to Kuala Lumpur City Centre.  A round-trip costs RM100, or $24 USD.<br/></p><p><strong>Where to Catch the Kuala Lumpur Airport Train</strong><br/></p><p>You can pre-purchase your tickets <a href="https://www.kliaekspres.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">online</a>, or you can purchase them at Kuala Lumpur Airport from the self-service kiosks or the KLIA Ekspres ticket counter.<br/></p><p><strong>KLIA</strong></p><p>You can find the ticket counter and train terminal at Level 1 of KLIA.<br/></p><p><strong>KLIA2</strong></p><p>The KLIA Ekspres train station at KLIA2 can be found inside the Gateway@KLIA2 Shopping Mall.</p><h2><span id="Kuala_Lumpur_Airport_Taxi"></span>Kuala Lumpur Airport Taxi<span></span></h2><p>Catching a taxi from Kuala Lumpur Airport to your accommodation in KL City Centre is the easiest and most convenient option.  </p><p>Despite being slower than the train and taking almost as long as the bus, your taxi driver will drop you at the door of your accommodation.  This will save you both time and money as you would otherwise need to find your own way back from KL Sentral or Pudu Sentral stations.<br/></p><p>On top of this, catching a taxi becomes more cost-effective in groups of two or more people.  For two people, it works out cheaper to take a taxi than the KLIA Ekspres.  For four people, a taxi becomes an enticing alternative to four separate bus fares.  <br/></p><p>If you are arriving in the middle of the night, then taking a taxi may also be your only option as the buses don’t typically run all through the night.  It is also safer than walking through the streets at night.<br/></p><p>Taxis from KLIA and KLIA2 run 24/7, with a 50% surcharge on fares from 00:00 to 06:00.  <br/></p><p>You also have the option to book a premier or luxury taxi from Kuala Lumpur Airport.  These are more spacious and comfortable, but cost twice as much as the budget taxis.<br/></p><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fCYT7jF5utX7KmDDbsdPtLNhFBJqA0knaHGtWlemYRWyl5OetHEDD1Mqnun_wHXUMHpsv_KhBNWlnASkP5D9PMvvD7xdtJKmkRQAboIK5cyQMZxFIuoiNYFV8T7jzsodkCVybfnc" alt="Taxi in Kuala Lumpur"/></figure><p><strong>Kuala Lumpur Airport Taxi Cost</strong><br/></p><p>A taxi from Kuala Lumpur Airport to the city centre will cost approximately RM75, or $18 USD.  This includes RM2 to purchase a metered taxi coupon, plus a fixed fee of RM3 and RM0.10 per km / 21 seconds, and any tolls.  There is a 50% surcharge from 00:00 to 06:00.<br/></p><p>You also have the option of purchasing a fixed-price coupon to pay for your fare in advance.  This usually works out to be more expensive than a metered taxi, but can be a good option if you are worried about getting scammed.  This should not cost more than RM75 from KLIA to KLCC.<br/></p><p><strong>Where to Find a Taxi at Kuala Lumpur Airport</strong><br/></p><p>From either KLIA or KLIA2 terminals, you will follow the signs to the taxi counters and stands.  Here, you will need to purchase a metered taxi coupon for RM2.
