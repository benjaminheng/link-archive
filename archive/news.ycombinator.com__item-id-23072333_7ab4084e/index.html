I also have friends who have been in tech for close to ten years, and are close to burning out though they would never admit to such.  This is the nature of the beast, all things that appear glamorous on the outside ( Hollywood, Finance, Tech, many nonprofits) is very rotten on the inside.<p>You can&#39;t change the past, but you can recalibrate your expectations and medidate on what went wrong. Here are some thoughts, and I will be very harsh:</p><p>1. Your co-workers may be amazing, but they were never your friends. You ran a business and rented their years to help them build a nest egg, of which you would claim the majority share had it hatched. Alas, the business failed and thus, you no longer add value to each other&#39;s lives. Move on.</p><p>2. There&#39;s what you love, and there&#39;s what you do. It&#39;s best to keep some distance: because no one cares about what you love. VCs are vultures and this is well known, but they are also reflecting the reality of the market. In the market you&#39;re just a vendor. Think about all the food stands that you have walked past in your life, within each stand is an immigrant family who slave away for decades hoping for a better life. Have you ever thought about them and gave them time/money for their suffering? No, you only cared them inso far as they can cook for you. This is how others saw you.</p><p>3. Big companies, and indeed most big institutions is made by a silent majority of the defeated. Many have experienced what you have said and have long made their peace. They found joy elsewhere, and found distance between themselves and their work.</p><p>4. Find self worth and self-love outside of your role in the machine, there&#39;s the product you produce to trade time for money, and then there&#39;s you. They are different things. Imagine Instagram influencers who post pictures of themselves but feel depressed when they don&#39;t get enough likes. This is you right now, you&#39;re looking for external validation from how big your integer is in some database. You have to look elsewhere.

Moving a bit further from the specifics, it&#39;s worth noting that this is not a natural state of affairs. Humans evolved to be in groups of about 30-100 people who they knew their whole lives and thus making catastrophic deception nearly impossible. Likewise vast sums of wealth did not exist nor total social and fiscal isolation surrounded by the complete opposite that characterize our city streets and daily life.<p>My point is that human psychology did not evolve in the context of our current world and will have enormous difficulty dealing with its bad sides. Although the specifics will vary, the number of people in the poster&#39;s position is undoubtedly enormous, with the vast majority too tired or ashamed of discussing it or just blaming themselves. This being the case, it would be nice to have serious study of it and resources to address it more effectively. Not to criticize any poster, but it is unfortunate than seeking advice from the web is currently the best one can do.

It is important to understand two things in coping with the state of the world in my opinion.<p>1) The reality is you need to find validation and fulfilment outside of work, because in our current society you are just a drone.</p><p>2) Don&#39;t be depressed because it seems like this is how it&#39;s always been. It hasn&#39;t. Our work culture is broken. People never used to be so far removed from their work. Trying to combine work and life is a natural thing, because people used to be tied up in it. Working the land, being close to home, running a family business, belonging to a small town of people you all known, having the social safety net of many people that are close to you and your family, being an independent contributor in the town&#39;s economy, etc. etc. This is how things were a few hundred years ago. Yes, there was less high tech gadgetry. There were corrupt officials, plagues, bad people. There will always be some element of this.</p><p>I really get the sense that so much of the first world&#39;s unhappiness right now is due to compartmentalising (the containerising if you like) of our lives. The solution to burnout at work is to create greater separation between work and home. But the problem itself is that we even need to do this. People can&#39;t live to enjoy what they do any more. You need to trade the majority of your waking hours for money you need to live. And when you do live, you&#39;re dreading returning to work and feeling burnout anyway. How depressing.</p><p>This is why the working-from-home trend that I hope COVID will kick-off is going to be a good thing. While we may still be working for the same companies, having a tighter integration between work and home is actually good for our mental health. Issues will be resolved faster. Nobody wants to be constantly angry in their own home. So if you&#39;re angry all the time while WFH, maybe you&#39;ll be more likely to look elsewhere. Taking breaks from work while at home is so much more refreshing. I can&#39;t think of anything more depressing that spending my lunch break in a work cafe with people I don&#39;t want to talk to, being flooded with fluorescent light, and thinking about how the rest of my working life will be spent in places like this.

This life came with 20–40% infant mortality and a very high rate of maternal death in childbirth (play 5+ rounds of not-quite-russian-roulette and the odds get pretty grim). Starvation and disease were ubiquitous. Many people suffered some now-trivial injury and ended up as lifelong cripples. The work was literally backbreaking and elderly people’s (i.e. &gt;50 years old) bodies were just wrecked after a career of hard manual labor, assuming they lived that long at all. People’s indoor time was spent in small dark rooms with an open hearth worse than the worst second-hand cigarette smoke you can possibly find, and unbelievably uncomfortable beds. In the best case food was mediocre (mostly bread or porridge or similar) and everyone was slightly malnourished, especially in the winter. People generally just shat outside near their houses and hoped the dogs would take care of it. If they wanted water (for drinking, bathing, ...) they’d have to carry it on their heads/backs from the nearest well or stream; water is very heavy.</p><p>People had to make literally everything in an extremely labor-intensive way from scratch: clothes, food, housing, furniture, toys, tools, etc. Raising sheep (or finding some other fiber) and then carding the wool, spinning the wool, weaving every piece of fabric on a hand loom, sewing fabric into clothes takes unbelievable amounts of human time. Making a small hut by hand takes weeks if not months of work (and the result is usually drafty, leaky, and not very comfortable). Making bread by hand including growing the grain and grinding it is nearly a full time job for everyone in the society.</p><p>If for whatever reason you were different from the expected norms (or just got unlucky and crossed the wrong gossipy neighbor) the rumors about you would mercilessly destroy your social life, and possibly result in exile or death if neighbors decided you were (e.g.) a witch.</p><p>The local nobles took every liberty with peasants: robbery, beatings as sport, rape, murder. The roads between towns were plagued with bandits.</p><p>Etc.</p><p>There’s a reason that the world has now experienced several centuries of dramatic migration <i>away</i> from rural peasant farming and <i>toward</i> horribly exploitative urban factory labor.

(Hunter–gatherer societies are different in many ways, though also often precarious.)</p><p>Rural peasants do not lack for work anxiety. Or anxiety in their interpersonal relationships. In rural peasant societies many people feel alienated. Domestic abuse is rampant. And so on.</p><p>There are many beautiful and nostalgic things about historical rural life.

It&#39;s not hard to see that there are certain benefits to working for oneself in one&#39;s own home vs. being a cog on an assembly line in some factory.</p><p>I imagine they were talking about farmers, not peasants. By the way the average medieval peasant had more time off than the average American worker since the work was seasonal. The takeaway there isn&#39;t &#34;let&#39;s return to medieval technology and start living like medieval peasants again&#34;, it&#39;s &#34;maybe there&#39;s something wrong with our society if despite the enormous technological advances from the past, certain elements of society like autonomy over one&#39;s time have regressed, controlling for technology&#34;.</p><p>Again, the original commenter was not arguing that we should all start living like the Amish. It&#39;s a failure of reading comprehension if that&#39;s how you interpreted it.

Imagine having a pressurised call-centre type role from home. Some people may feel greater pressure to appear &#39;corporate&#39; in the home environment, others might not mind their kids or cats interrupting a Zoom meeting. Not everyone can create a suitable WFH environment in a nice spare room.</p><p>Whether this actually happens depends on corporate culture, the personalities and goals of the managers and employees, whether a crunch is on, and many other factors.

My grandfather was a farmer, rural town in Europe. The village was essentially ruled by three people (just before WWII): the mayor, the police officer and the priest.

I think he took a single vacation to Italy when he got married. Work has never been about “realising your dream” until somewhat recently I think... Maybe watch the movie “The Dark Valley”. 
A big difference may have been (and it is probably still how cultures and immigration clash): how family vs. society are seen. Germans see the government stand above family and all (e.g., government will take care of you, not family). Western societies have (deliberately) broken the family in its function. But that was probably necessary.<p>Humans adapt, that’s why we became what we are. Not sure I have the desire to “live with 100
people in a village I don’t like” encoded in my DNA.</p><p>I don’t want to downplay any anxiety or frustration, but I believe every generation had it/felt it the same way. We push and work ourselves up until we reach the level if anxiety we cannot longer cope with.</p><p>Objectively speaking: Who would prefer going back 250 years in history? No way on earth.

You could just as easily apply any of the methods of governance that humanity has devised to resolve a conflict so I don&#39;t think the method of governance is crucial to the resolution of conflict. I think that getting both parties to agree to a satisfactory resolution is what is critical. That can be done with force as in a hierarchy where an external party enforces a resolution on both conflicting parties or it could be done without outside intervention, this obviously happens all the time in a variety of situations.</p><p>Ideally, every conflict should be able to be resolved directly by the people involved without additional harm being caused. Maybe there is a way through education or other tools that we can build that would allow people to resolve any conflict in such a manner? Maybe prevention is the best remedy and there exists a way to defuse conflict before it reaches a level that cannot be easily resolved. My point is that resorting to authority or force is not the only solution.

He was closing a deal with a company and they asked for a higher valuation, and he thought objectively it&#39;s merited. But then he thought: &#34;if I give you the higher valuation, then you would have more and I would have less, but I want more&#34;. And that&#39;s the root of it, human nature.

My friend and I were talking about what business culture is like in a certain area of the world, and he said: they oversell everything, so take everything they say and divide it by two, and start from there. So part of it is also a pre-emptive mechanism based on a history of such behaviors from <i>others</i>.</p><p>None of this make things &#34;ok&#34;, but I&#39;m just sharing an anecdote from the other side.

There&#39;s a world of difference between telling someone you&#39;re their friend and will protect them and nothing will go wrong when you know there&#39;s a good chance it will, and telling (or <i>being</i>) a friend but being up front that your job means you will act a certain way in specific situations, and that may be against the interests of others.</p><p>This happens in business, and it happens in personal life.  I <i>respect</i> people that are consistent and represent themselves accurately, even if I don&#39;t like them or agree with them.  People that misrepresent themselves are relying on an information asymmetry that they&#39;re creating to give themselves an advantage.  This clearly works in many instances, but it also a &#34;burnt-bridges&#34; strategy that only works because of the relative anonymity that modern society provides.  In some ways, this could be solved by more information about these people and how they function (which is how the free market works, best with more and more accurate info), but that&#39;s hard to accomplish because of their relative power.

Our lives outside of work were fantastic! Great friends, nice house, lots of weekend activities, got my first pup (waiting my whole life to have my own place so I could have one), had my twins a year later.<p>But good God was my job (big company, lots of politics and bad management... the usual) absolutely soul crushing. I thought that I&#39;d be able to make my peace with it in lieu of everything else which was near perfect, but the more time dragged on, the more it crushed me and sucked joy out of the other areas of my life. I will never forget the sense of existential dread that would overcome me every Sunday evening and the relief on Friday evenings.</p><p>Fortunately I was able to leave and take up an opportunity at a small startup in the ML/consulting space. It&#39;s entirely bootstrapped, so no VC people fucking everything up, and the management are incredibly nice and decent humans, and several of them I count as close friends. I love the work that I do, and I am almost always learning new things. I&#39;ve been working here for 4 years, and I have never yet experienced that existential dread on a Sunday evening. Work is just another part of my life that I enjoy now, and it is incredible how happy and fulfilled I am with my life. My wife has fortunately experienced the same with the move and change in jobs.</p><p>I get hit up by recruiters for the big tech companies all the time and there simply is no reason why I would ever consider working at any of those companies to be another cog in the wheel.

So I knew enough about the company and when they needed to hire someone, him being able to vouch for me was enough to get me an interview with them.<p>That being said, I think places like ziprecruiter / indeed will still have job postings from smaller companies. The challenge, as you mentioned, is trying to figure out the good ones from the sketchy/shitty ones. Small companies can also be challenging if the management isn&#39;t great and they have bad culture. So I would definitely place a lot of weight on that if I were interviewing at smaller companies.

Confusing the two causes suffering. I have worked at an adtech company with really good people. I helped start a nonprofit publication in Brooklyn full of college friends, artists and academics- which ended up being the sleaziest group of backstabbing grubs imaginable.</p><p>I have a manager right now whom I respect. He (CTO) gives good project guidance and makes clear decisions based on rational business reasons... I like him but have no illusions that he would fire me in a second if it were in the interests of the company. Keeping this in the back of my mind helps me modulate my response when I am frustrated or really almost any emotion to the excess.</p><p>Its possible to do very meaningful work without being friends. You can even be friendly and go out and drink together from time to time ... but always remember what you are there for.</p><p>You can find meaningful experiences out of work. They can even be &#34;worklike&#34;. I am an EMT on weekends and I end up thinking about it during the week. The relationships at the corps are important but in the back of my mind I can understand that this activity is not exactly work. It could be but at the moment it is not. I am a systems engineer.</p><p>There is a lot to unpack in this. I strongly agree with you that work is about as central to our identity as can be.</p><p>I&#39;ve been miserable at NYC tech companies with unlimited vacation and catered lunches... And a crappy attitude was at least 50% of that misery. (2 months of covid-19 and I find myself missing the commute at times)</p><p>When I was in school I worked for the university for free tuition. I was a groundskeeper and mowed and planted. I was outside. I occasionally drove a dumptruck to get loads of gravel or dirt. I worked with a guy who dropped out of highschool and played heavy metal in our truck as we drove around campus. When it rained we would hide out and play chess. He was an interesting dude full of contradictions.</p><p>I hated the job because I felt humiliated as a student working a menial job on campus. In hindsight I can see how important a job it was. It enabled me to get through school and afford a place to live. There were fun moments and good experiences (driving a full dumptruck down route18 is its own thrill...)</p><p>I was limited mostly by my attitude and a posture - who I thought I was. Dreaming about being somewhere else and avoiding people I knew.</p><p>I still catch myself engaging in that kind of behavior.</p><p>We do need to relate to each other as humans though work. This requires lots of re-calibration.

I did recognize symptoms the last couple years (sometimes I was physically unable to work while staring at the screen). My plan was to take a couple months off and then take a contract position doing development. I have been unable to even look earnestly since I secretly cannot stand the idea of going into another enterprise situation. It all seems to me to be utter bullshit. I realize that even though I have had burnout issues a couple times over the last 30 years, this is a major case of burnout that I am experiencing. I have always identified as a programmer, not just worked as a programmer. That was a mistake. I am currently unable to fully retire but now I can think about what else I should do. It is funny how profound this is to me right now all due to simply reading comments.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I was young, passionate, and believed in doing the best work I could. I was addicted to work and pushed myself to deliver. I did, and built a career. I left after almost a decade at that company and went to a new job that had 20x the employees and was well resourced.<p>I got to kick back a bit and the job was more about delivering accurately and not delivering volume. I spent the first 3 years in that position recovering from prior burnout while still working. I got bored, so I quit and started a business. I worked myself for years right into the ground, burned out again. I took a few months off and relaxed. I ended up geting bored again before I fully recovered and went back to work.</p><p>I changed career tracks and switched technologies figuring this would give me a challenge and excitement. A new profession, systems, and rules of engagement. I was truly excited at first and I worked hard. Then I burned out again, before having recovered from prior burnout. This time it isn&#39;t due to lack of work/life balance, its due to lack of technological and social satisfaction.</p><p>At first I thought it was a bout of imposter syndrome as it&#39;s a new career but as time went on I realized it&#39;s more about the industry, the direction it&#39;s going, and the effects of people getting into STEM for money and not because they&#39;re technologists. It&#39;s a lot of younger folks who boast about their adderall abuse, get excited to give presentations, and other stuff that I&#39;m really not interested in.</p><p>I&#39;m stuck in burnout #3 now. It’s easier to burn out after the first one. I don&#39;t have the ability to make a risky move at the moment, I have people who depend on me. I don&#39;t know what my next move is now but as you age and your responsibility grows your options shrink. I think I might ride out the virus and look for a new job in the hopes a new environment will give me a push to keep going.

I&#39;ve been where you are, not from the exact same path, but what you&#39;re feeling is familiar to me.<p>My two cents: I find joy doing challenging work on products that are useful to a bunch of people without needing to be &#34;the next big thing&#34;. But what I find more joy in is my life outside of work, in spending time with and taking care of my extended family (including my close friends). The most success I&#39;ve had with this so far has been at a big tech company. This is for a number of reasons: the product I work on is more likely to be useful to lots of people that way (because a lot of the marketing work has been done already), which also makes the work challenging (because scale brings challenges), and compensation and work-life balance are good so I can spend a lot of low-stress time focusing on family. I personally find the most joy working on things that mostly make money through charging people money for services because it feels like the most honest way for my salary to be paid, but I&#39;m not sure how much that relates to this, it might just be a personal preference. Reading your post, I wondered whether you misinterpreted your big-tech coworkers. They might not have been checked out, they might have just been doing their work while having other interests that were more important to them. That is my interpretation of the people I work with (and of myself). I think it can look pretty lame to excited young people, but it&#39;s actually the opposite; what&#39;s lame is being super into working rather than other better things.</p><p>But as a follow-on, something I&#39;ve been thinking about recently is whether I can take the useful skills I&#39;ve built through a career in tech and apply them elsewhere, supported by the savings I&#39;ve been able to build up. I&#39;m not sure what that looks like, but being able to gather, process, analyze, and operationalize data seems important for lots of things, and that&#39;s something I know how to do (and I&#39;m not alone here, software is largely about processing data). But I don&#39;t know what the most useful thing is to do with those skills; right now what seems important and in demand is epidemiology, but it&#39;s probably too late to become useful to this moment. Probably something in the broad sustainability space is more forward-looking. I&#39;m still looking around.</p><p>I guess the two points I&#39;m trying to make are: 1. You may be able to find joy by having more modest expectations, and 2. There may be other useful things to do with the skills you built, you should keep your eyes open for them.</p><p>Hope this helps a bit, cheers!

I have many friends that I haven&#39;t met through work, but when you spend the bulk of your day with people you form bonds - and friendships - with them.

This is how others saw you.</p><p>I don&#39;t seek out the immigrant family, but I&#39;m friendly and cordial with them. I chat with them and treat them as equals. I pay them fairly for what they provide me. I don&#39;t try to squeeze every last cent out of them or negotiate my meal from them, or make them feel like less of a person. And in return they provide the same. Maybe I&#39;m naive, sure. But if so, at least I&#39;m not an asshole.</p><p>&gt; Big companies, and indeed most big institutions is made by a silent majority of the defeated.</p><p>This is mostly true. I agree.

Unfortunately, in the US at least, a lot of people don&#39;t have that attitude and _are_ obsessed with making money at all costs. And our society (at least in the US) has been built in ways that praise that sort of attitude. But there are plenty of people who aren&#39;t like that. It&#39;s hard to find them sometimes, depending on what sort of circles you run in and the sort of people you surround yourself with - but they are out there.

At least that was my take away, I can’t say for sure that was his goal.<p>Do I think that your therapist would judge you for your problems? Absolutely not, if they are even an OK therapist. They are professionals, and are not trying to be your friend.</p><p>Another thing. The first therapist I went to sucked. She had me doing worksheets and other stuff that just didn’t work for me. I ended up switching (my wife made me switch) to a new therapist and it was a huge difference. If you do end up trying therapy, remember that this is a professional situation. You wouldn’t go to the same bad sandwich shop for lunch every day. If your therapist isn’t working for you, and you have given them a honest try, just switch therapists.</p><p>Ultimately, therapy was a leap of faith that I’m glad I took.

Isn&#39;t that something worth addressing and examining to understand better?<p>Being unhappy for any reason matters. I discovered I was unhappy for much more valid reasons than I ever imagined and taking that leap to therapy was quite life changing.

Work is important for sure, but there are other sources of joy in life. I can&#39;t help but think that Americans miss so much in life because of their obsession with work, money, and social status. Hence such posts on HN.

I&#39;d just like to add that this advice is specific to article OP who was running a business. As an owner/operator, he/she is tasked with the responsibility to allocate capital/resources in an effective way (morality of capitalism notwithstanding, in the current system once you take the job, it&#39;s no longer about you). It&#39;s one thing to use love and passion as rhetoric, but as an employee I would prefer the person up top made rational decisions, and maintained some distance with each employee. What often happens is that for every employee the boss befriends, many are on the losing side of it.<p>I think a lot of people are generalizing the comment to people in all positions. I&#39;ve befriended many people I worked with over the years, but I was not the one paying them, giving or denying them opportunities. I also really loved what I did, but I was not the one making sure it had exchange value on the market. Friendship, &#34;passion&#34;, etc are really luxuries the OP wanted in this position, but really could not afford in large quantities.

It&#39;s a vicious cycle of horribleness.  The same people always seem to get the new development also because they were &#34;so successful with the last launch&#34; and the people maintaining it are perceived as slow and ineffectual because it takes so long to iterate (ironically because of the person who looks like a rock star).</p><p>I feel very lucky in my career that I don&#39;t have to put up with this anymore.  If I could go back in time I would just tell myself to quit and find a more compatible company instead of suffering for years under a self-destructive system that punishes people like me.  Since breaking free from that and starting my own projects, I&#39;ve been very successful.</p><p>I don&#39;t mean to imply that I always write perfect code, or even great code, because surely I don&#39;t.  I do expect some things to be throwaway that end up staying around.  But doing something correct rather than fast in general is a much better long term strategy.

It&#39;s 10x easier to do it right the first time.  Messy code to me is most messy because it&#39;s unclear what is being done.  It often comes with insufficient tests, which makes refactoring dangerous.</p><p>To me it&#39;s a lot like walking into a messy house vs. a clean house.  If the house has clutter everywhere, or has a smell from being dirty, then it&#39;s not comfortable to be in.  If I have to work in it, or clean it, I&#39;d much rather start with a well-organized clean house.</p><p>Refactoring is also not fun at all for me.  I also LOVE pushing features fast.  I don&#39;t obsess over &#34;perfect code&#34; but I do obsess over following best practices and stopping for a few minutes to think through a design.</p><p>My workflow is:</p><p>1.  Get it working, minimal effort, PoC</p><p>2.  Get tests written and passing.</p><p>3.  Refactor to good code.  Perfect is the enemy of good, but it doesn&#39;t get committed until it&#39;s readable, maintainable, tested, documented.</p><p>Sometimes I probably am a little slower than I otherwise could be, but people are often blown away at my ability to iterate and add features quickly.  This is because my code is well organized, modular, DRY, and well tested.  It takes a little longer the first release, but it more than pays for itself speed-wise as tech debt stays minimum and hackability is high.  With over 10 years experience now with this method I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s the only sane way to do things.  Anything else is sabotaging your own future.</p><p>If I really don&#39;t have time to do it right the first time, I know it will be hard to iterate on, it will have bugs in prod, and it will never be pleasant to work in.  It takes 10x longer to refactor an existing app to be good code than it does to do it during development when it&#39;s all fresh in mind.  The best hope is that it has a good spec so it can be re-written from scratch.

The problem here is that people forget that building software professionally is an engineering job. Like other forms of engineering, there are processes and good practices to facilitate both functional and non functional aspects of a software and the building process. While the extra burden of version control, testability and extendability takes some of the fun away, I would have reservations working with someone who pushes directly to a release branch, does not write test and hardcode values instead of uaing configuration. It&#39;s about balance and realising that job is a job.

Though I&#39;m not sure if this is a valid example to counter my view. I can&#39;t comment on the exact situation you went through. It could be that that complexity was a side effect of having to solve far more complex and frequent issues more easily as opposed to doing simpler and rarer things more easily (unless of course changing button colours is a frequent modification). It&#39;s also possible that the design was simply bad.<p>This doesn&#39;t mean that you were going to better off without git workflows, code reviews, tests. My experience has been the opposite. It&#39;s exactly where there&#39;s no good technical leads/technical discussions/code reviews I have seen this kind of mess. Each person goes on and do their own thing with no clear direction or architecture.</p><p>At the end of the day, for me, to stay sane in the face of this kind of nonsense(as in bad engineers - unfortunately there are those even at senior positions), so what if the button that could have taken a few minutes to change now takes 6 days if we are paid to do it? As a responsible engineer, you point out the issue perhaps with a proposal for improvement. If they listen, good. If they don&#39;t, fuck it. On the other hand, if all I end up doing is changing colors of buttons regularly, each taking a week, then for the sake of my career, just say no and move on - unless of course if the pay is so good that it makes sense to spend a couple years doing it - people have to do far more shitty jobs for less. And spend some of the free time to code like a cowboy :)

What some people consider to be &#34;good engineering&#34; is a <i>different set of standards</i>, a <i>different set of qualifiers</i>.</p><p>Let&#39;s go back to 2012. I was yet again doing web stuff.</p><p>We had this hodgepodge of jasmine, junit, eslint and selenium and couldn&#39;t commit unless it all passed</p><p>But the tests broke more then the code itself, because it was &lt;far more complicated then the thing being tested&gt;. So more time was spent on fixing and babysitting the tests then writing the damn software.</p><p>Alas, we <i>finally</i> released and it totally completely bombed. Why?</p><p>Because those test suites don&#39;t care if something &#34;feels&#34; clunky or &#34;looks&#34; wrong ...The machine responded to the interface in machine time, it didn&#39;t actually test human time, which was the only thing that mattered. We should have relied on human dogfooding, like the business books say to do. I got arrogantly laughed at for suggesting it, multiple times; that simply wasn&#39;t &#34;engineering&#34; to this team.</p><p>Now of course tests are valuable, sometimes. But &#34;sometimes&#34;, that&#39;s the important thing. Understanding when to make that call is actually important. When, where, what, why, and how - not just important for journalists.</p><p>But instead, like some 18th century royal court disconnected from reality, we did ceremony. So we wrote tests, most of them bullshit. One of the tests was essentially: &#34;Does this image on the page load from s3?&#34;</p><p>At least that one usually passed.</p><p>Except when AWS was down or our internet went out: &#34;I guess we can&#39;t work today, the does_image_load_from_s3 test is preventing the commit.&#34; They were a waste of time and got in the way of actual work. But we <i>HAD</i> to have them, we <i>MUST</i>, right? Nonsense.</p><p>I&#39;m convinced the tests were there because &#34;doing it right&#34; was about virtue signaling. So we built a salary defending potempkin village composed of pure thought stuff.</p><p>I imagine it all like a catholic mass: Men in robes walk around, ring bells, and use special boxes to wash their hands with special cloths; it&#39;s all very important if you go to church, but that&#39;s the point, it&#39;s praxis and faith: we were coding from plato&#39;s cave, creating intricate  shadows of reality representing actual work.</p><p>Symbols passing as tools: like Dumbo fetishizing the feather and being oh so worried when it falls, everything passed the most sophisticated testing I had ever seen yet the program still crashed in the user&#39;s hands almost every time.  All that work was mere ceremony.</p><p>Understanding how modern computing speeds and vc capital has allowed people to be wrapped up in their own bullshit, call it programming and get away with it, is a major insight into why technology sucks today.</p><p>It&#39;s not just you, everyone agrees. It&#39;s lame now.

If you have a better approach that can validate the software is correct then I&#39;m all ears. If you have a better collaboration tool than git, I&#39;d be happy to try it. With all due respect, what I can&#39;t do is take your word for it that you can build software that works (covers all functional and non functional specs), and they continue to work as more code is added, and is worked on by more than one or two developers, and that you can continue to validate and roll out more software over the years even when the original developers aren&#39;t around. It&#39;s difficult, costly. It can work, it&#39;s just not the best way. The industry will evolve and come up with better tools and processes than we have today as we did before yesterday. Only thing I took from the couple examples you gave is that you&#39;ve had the misfortune of working in some terrible teams. Though I still don&#39;t see how you&#39;d be better off without the rest of the usual practices we have today. The guys who couldn&#39;t code the tests, I can&#39;t imagine them building a non trivial software well either. I&#39;m not defending any one process. I just don&#39;t agree that we don&#39;t need any process, and that we should just write code that (seems to) works.

Tests are a productivity tool, they&#39;re supposed to make your job easier by providing faster feedback. If manual test is faster than automated test, your automated tests are shit. If they&#39;re causing developers to write the bare minimum of tests it will only generate a false sense of security.

A lot of this is driven by the agile approach. It&#39;s tailor-made for dev burnout: from the endless tight cycles that force people into an infinite loop of productivity with scant satisfaction that comes with &#34;completion&#34;, to all of the tools and philosophies designed to juice that endless loop to be successful/workable. CI/CD, Git, TDD, etc. These all <i>impose</i> on the developer&#39;s creativity, independence, and enjoyment. They turn devs into cogs--assembly line workers who must not stop the line at any cost.</p><p>One example: back in the day there was a nightly build, not a continuous one. And, you checked out a file, worked on it, and checked it back in. If someone else needed it they had to wait. That obviously had its limitations and it seems laughable by today&#39;s standards. But, it was reflective of a <i>human</i> pace that considered devs as people vs. optimizable assets. That is, it was workable because the expectations on devs weren&#39;t insane. But, now we commit and merge. Think of how much less fun it is to spend your time resolving merge conflicts.</p><p>More to the point, the approach itself implies a chaotic pace wherein code that meets the standards of a certain box must be produced at all times. Devs must bear the cost of resolving any conflicts (literally) that arise from this chaotic pace.</p><p>Likewise, with CI/CD. And don&#39;t get me started on the monkey-work that is TDD. You might argue that it improves code quality. But, it&#39;s hard to make the case that it improves job satisfaction. If you move more work from the creative, problem-solving bucket into the busy-work bucket, the result will <i>not</i> be personal fulfillment.</p><p>Does agile increase productivity for companies? Sure. But, it comes at a high cost that&#39;s mostly paid by devs.

So many companies now allow the <i>process</i> to manage devs. PMs back then frequently over-focused on the work vs. people, but even many of them have been replaced with some version of a scrum master with an even more relentless focus on the never-ending storyboard. They&#39;re driving the work over people approach without apology because it&#39;s what the process demands.</p><p>This is not to say it&#39;s 100% the case across all companies.

Nominally it&#39;s a sort of Agile-type workflow (Kanban-ish), but because there&#39;s hardware design and manufacturing in the loop, things get planned out early and the multi-month plan doesn&#39;t change very much. New algorithm ideas pop up and get scheduled, new ways of doing sensor filtering pop up and get scheduled, but the direction of the wind doesn&#39;t change at the start of every &#34;sprint&#34;. There are no sprints, just a prioritized/sequenced task list that gets reevaluated periodically.</p><p>(Plus, I get to go back to my old days C-hacker roots.

We prioritized what we wanted to get done in the 3 months and what we didn&#39;t get finished fell off to the next cycle. This was done in BigCompanyYou&#39;veHeardOf and SmallSoftwareDevelopmentCo.</p><p>In my experience, waterfall project plans were never meant to be in stone, they were just a guide to give us an idea of what the project looked like. I&#39;ve done a 3 year plan too. I&#39;m sure some places implemented it strictly, probably government or heavily bureaucratic institutions.

When I was a kid, I learned to program very young: Basic around 8, C in DOS around 11, C on Linux around 13. I fiddled with electronics some, but didn&#39;t really <i>get it</i>. I took the EE part of my schooling specifically because I wanted to learn more about how computers worked &#34;under the hood&#34; so to speak.</p><p>From there, I ran a web consultancy for a while, and ended up with a client that had a more math-heavy project. And then another client showed up with a project where a microcontroller made sense, and then another... My business partner was moving across the country, and I was enjoying what I was working on quite a bit more than I was in the web/mobile space, so we decided to part ways. I still do the occasional web/mobile project, but they&#39;re generally hardware-related (e.g. the Bluetooth connectivity portion of an IoT-type system). Over the years I&#39;ve accumulated probably $15-20k worth of equipment and software license, and the customers keep showing up!

It was very hard for me to get parts, living in the middle of nowhere in rural Southern Brazil, but some folks in the mailing list were super cool and shipped me parts from the US. I live in the US now.</p><p>I&#39;m a CS major but took electives in embedded systems in college, and those were some of the most enjoyable classes I took. I&#39;m now working on recalling some of that. Ordered some PIC parts and I&#39;m currently taking an edX course on ARM programming.</p><p>My only problem right now is, I have no idea how I&#39;d get into that space having a whole career built on server-side software.

When you stop having different roles, then you implicitly assume that your lead architect and your junior trainee can do the same work, albeit at different speeds.

Academia doesn&#39;t have this problem of isolation of ideas, and every professor there is has an office. Communicating to your colleagues is a company culture issue, not a physical space issue.<p>Fresh out of undergrad, open office layouts feel familiar to the long hours spent sitting at big tables in library basements, so I can see why some people like it initially.

Form B was put in place by a legal team, who don&#39;t provide any point of contact, and who are not your friendly local legal team.</p><p>Because the process of filling out forms is so time-consuming, your engineering team uses Asana to track it. However, your PMs use an excel spreadsheet, the legal team uses JIRA, your copywriters use a google doc, and the teams that own forms B and C use separate internally created tools. You update your form-filling progress in 6 different places, some of which have bugs and others of which aren&#39;t actively monitored, so you also have to use email/slack/skype messages to follow up the right people. Some of the right people are actually the wrong people. Some of the right people reject your proposal because they didn&#39;t read it properly.

Because, of course it&#39;s cool that these CI build processes kick off at commit points (or whatever). And, of course, the near instantaneous feedback that something is broken is more efficient than awaiting a nightly build. OTOH, we were much more cautious about the code we checked in because the stakes were higher and you didn&#39;t want to be the heel who broke the build. &#34;Move fast and break things&#34; was not a thing. Instead, &#34;be thoughtful about what you&#39;re claiming to be good code&#34; was the ethos.</p><p>But, this is not an argument about efficiency or whether these things can be made to work. The argument is about the cost to the developer of all of these things in sum, and the philosophy they serve.</p><p>Likewise with TDD. I&#39;m not arguing that tests don&#39;t help code quality and I&#39;ve heard others say they like writing them. YMMV and all that. But, it&#39;s more load on the developer and I&#39;ve definitely seen it overdone.</p><p>So, again, without the reference of a &#34;saner&#34; world then you don&#39;t <i>likely</i> have the context to fully appreciate these costs. I see them, though, and frequently hear them when people complain about burnout. It&#39;s not CI/CD or TDD or whatever that&#39;s the problem. It&#39;s that these things are frequently used less as tools and more as the instruments of a philosophy that plugs developers in alongside them as just another part of the never-ending pipeline.

A gross violation of standard, probably, but it works! It definitely added a lot of joy.</p><p>I typed “git init” only after I finished the first working version which had a regular One-color LED, and could not yet do blinking :-)

Mutiny is hardly an answer to the problem here. It will certainly temporarily avoid the problems you face but if you are a member of a team and this is truly how you act you will get chucked out very quickly. But since you bring up a few of the issues you are facing it&#39;s important to address them. I want to focus on unit tests to start.<p>When I started my first programming job a couple of years ago I joined a team that demanded 100% code coverage. I hated them so much. I was still learning the ropes at this company and I only saw the unit tests as a barrier to getting my work done and earning my paycheck. My first solution was to create bogus tests that always passed. That was quickly discovered and I was reprimanded. My second solution was to get colleagues who shared my hate for unit tests to approve my PRs before they were reviewed by my team. That too was thwarted.</p><p>Then one day I was working with a teammate on a new feature and we discovered a bug. He quickly opened up a test file and wrote a unit test, then he went tried a couple solutions until the test turned green. Then he looked at me and said, &#34;When when you are working in a pile of crap, testing makes you feel more confident about your code.&#34; That was my first insight into the value of testing. Eventually I came around and stopped trying to avoid tests. I just did the damn work. Once I established trust with my teammates they began to let the pressure off my PRs and slowly the displeasure of writing tests went away.</p><p>You pointed out a few different coding practices that frustrate you. And to be honest, those coding practices are not the gospel and should be deployed only when truly needed. However I think you have a serious problem with what a lot of us call being a good teammate. At the end of the day your goal should be to get the product shipped, once you focus on getting your features out the door, unit testing and pull requests become minor details in that process. At the end of the day those are just a cutesy to your teammates to show them that you are willing to be a responsible and helpful team member. Stop trying to fight everyone so much and maybe you will enjoy your job a little more.

And the software was very good, didn&#39;t ship with many bugs (and when it did they got fixed real quick), and there were never any catastrophic, non-recoverable issues, nor ever any questions on the integrity of the system or my reporting.

                  <p><span>While I dabbled with python and Delphi for a bit,my first real development was on Salesforce platform with their proprietary language called Apex. The first thing every developer learns on thos platform is that your code has to have at least 75% test coverage before it can be pushed to production.Testing was inevitable and ultimately part of anything I had to write. With time,I started reading more and more about development, tried different languages and etc.It was really fascinating to read how a lot of people hate testing or teams skip them if the deadlines need to be met. What testing taught me is that if the test is hard to write,it means that the code is crap.Every time I wrote some quick hack,it used to take me 10 times longer to write unit test.</span></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p><span>Unit tests are time-consuming and tedious to write, and generally deliver poor effort-per-bug-found except for initial development (especially since they often displace cross-component tests which tend to catch more bugs). And the cases they test simply reflect the prejudices and lack of imagination of the author. A far better alternative IME is to use generative testing (e.g. property-based testing), which automates the tedium of generating test cases, and finds far more bugs to boot. Bonus: you&#39;ll understand your code much better after you&#39;re forced to identify and formalize invariants (&#34;properties&#34;) in order to write your tests!</span></p></div></td></tr>

And I love them. I have a few multi-year projects that sit and do their thing for months at a time with no changes; when I come back to them with a client request, the test suite is awesome for making sure that whatever I just changed didn&#39;t break something else (alternatively, the tests point out an assumption I made when writing the tests and the test needs to be changed). Either way, I appreciate it. Especially when there&#39;ve been changes done by other people that I wasn&#39;t aware of.<p>Buuuuut... a lot of the personal projects I&#39;ve worked on have zero unit tests. Maybe they have a couple of tests around a complicated algorithm, but mostly... no automated testing. What they do have though is a) version control, and b) a fast-iteration platform underneath them. They&#39;re also generally well factorered into small chunks.</p><p>As an example, I have a package that takes an org-mode file and extracts time entries to drive into time tracking software a client uses. Written in Lisp, zero tests. Every month I fire it up, look at the table of entries it&#39;s about to post, and hit &#34;go&#34;. Looking at the table of entries provides two sanity checks: first, that I properly logged my hours that month (I&#39;ll occasionally forget to clock out for a weekend and rack up a 48 hour time log), and second, that it didn&#39;t encounter a bug while doing the processing. As of around September of last year, this program is <i>done</i>, and does its job perfectly every month.</p><p>Another example, also in Lisp, is used for making estimates for my clients. I give it a list of tasks with 3-point estimates, it churns through and calculates all the means and standard deviations, generates a file for Pandoc to consume, and spits out a PDF. I use it every couple of months. No tests, all done inside the SBCL repl. I obviously proofread the output PDF before sending it to a client, but that&#39;s again to check for bugs and to check for brain farts.</p><p>I&#39;ve worked on great codebases that have giant test suites, and I&#39;ve worked on terrible codebases that have giant test suites. And likewise for no test suites. While I appreciate the sentiment, I think it&#39;s dangerous to talk in absolutes like that. While I agree there is probably some degree of correlation between whether or not a codebase has a unit test suite and whether it&#39;s good code, writing unit tests does not intrinsically make the codebase good, and not writing unit tests does not intrinsically make a codebase bad.

Depending on how the codebase is structured, changing the tests to match the new desired behaviour might be trivial or might be excruciatingly complicated. These days (mentioned elsewhere in this discussion) I&#39;m working on more embedded stuff, and the only time I&#39;m generally writing unit tests are for things that shouldn&#39;t change.</p><p>As an example, last year I was working on a custom LoRaWAN stack. As I was building out the various pieces, I was writing tests to verify that the output from generally-pure functions came out as expected. (This packet) + (This key) = (This encrypted packet). Those kinds of tests help a ton for catching stupid mistakes.

Games companies prize iteration speed in terms of how quickly you can test a change in situ because we as game makers need to verify our changes by playing the game. I&#39;m making a multiplayer game right now so I need to make sure what I do works on the server and clients which usually necessitates three copies of the game running together. Then we playtest it with a larger group weekly and playtest with even larger groups less regularly.</p><p>My impression of a lot of modern development elsewhere is that as soon as automated tests are green the code gets punted into production which seems utterly bonkers.

Naming conventions, unit tests, and general documentation all exist to help other team members keep up with the pace of changes in the repository. If you&#39;re not planning to do something in a team setting or for this to be consumed outside of the work that you do then you don&#39;t need these things. But if you want to share with everyone else it&#39;s important that you don&#39;t totally ignore these things because it will come back to bite you in the long run.
