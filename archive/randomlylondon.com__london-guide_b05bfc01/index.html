<p><strong>London in a sentence:</strong> <em>&#34;London is a city by a river, plus lots of villages joined up by an underground railway.&#34;</em> - <a href="https://twitter.com/TubeRambler" target="_blank">@TubeRambler</a></p>

<p>My oldest Canadian friend and his girlfriend are planning on making their first trip to London in July and wanted some ideas on places to stay and things to do. The problem, of course, is that there are so many different areas to stay in and things to do, that narrowing down the list to something useful and manageable can actually be quite difficult. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve written this incomplete guide for them in particular but I hope you will find at least some of the advice useful for your situation. I should note however that this guide is intended for people in their early 30s, from North America, staying for only a few nights and who would like to see the major sights. If that&#39;s not you then you might not find it so helpful.</p>
<h2>London vs. Toronto (or New York, Chicago, etc.)</h2>
<p>When thinking about London it is important to remember that:  </p>
<ul>
<li>London is much more historic than Toronto</li>
<li>London has far fewer tall buildings than Toronto</li>
<li>London doesn&#39;t have a single downtown area like Toronto</li>
<li>London has far more wealthy areas than Toronto</li>
<li>London has a far better public transportation system than Toronto (fact: the metro system is known as the Underground or tube, <strong>not</strong> the subway. The term &#39;subway&#39; refers to a walkway under a road)</li>
<li>London can seem to shut down earlier than Toronto; the standard time for last orders at a pub is usually 11 PM or 12 AM. However, there are lots of late-night drinking venues if you know where to look.</li>
<li>London&#39;s major geographic feature isn&#39;t a lake but the Thames, which divides the city north-south. </li>
<li>Like Toronto, London is divided into neighbourhoods and each one has its own unique character. However, given that the cities are so different, there isn&#39;t really a like-for-like comparison.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to Stay In London</h2>

<p>Obviously, the cheapest accommodation option is to stay with someone you know. This of course assumes you know someone who lives in London. </p>
<p>However, even if you do know someone living in London, it&#39;s important to remember that many Londoners in their late 20s/early 30s are still living in flat shares. Thus staying with them is not always a practical option â€“ especially if you value your privacy.   </p>
