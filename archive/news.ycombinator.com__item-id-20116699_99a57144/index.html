I live alone, spend most evenings alone, and on top, work&#39;s coding and research has been slow for 2 weeks. Collaborators are at conferences and on vacation, so I had much less work and much less face-to-face contact than usual. Given that I code on my own, distribute analyses via email, and occasionally meet if people are around, I barely talked to people some days this week.<p>Going home feels so meh... I can watch more Sherlock Holmes videos (Jeremy Brett!), rewatch Parks and Rec or The Office, or work on music or art, but there is no one to share with, no one to quip with, no one to engage with on my passions. I just kinda laze about without more contact and stimulus.</p><p>And I do have a better social circle now than I have since I left home at age 18...minus the daily familial, non-work interaction. I can&#39;t wait to hit the phase of life with a partner and/or family living with me.</p><p>If anyone in Providence, RI wants to hang, let me know!

If somebody proposed doing something together and I was able, I had to do it. That made a <i>huge</i> difference in my life. I did a lot of things that were... unexpected. (A few examples: I joined an ultimate frisbee league. I went skydiving. I joined a church group. I went to a strip club. I attended a wedding.) It wasn&#39;t all fun or even pleasant, but I wasn&#39;t lonely anymore.<p>The internet was just getting started then, so that experiment might work out differently now, but it&#39;s worth considering how much of our modern isolation is just a matter of choices.

I started this rule with her from the moment we met. I think it is part of why we stayed together all these years, and why we worked out well when so many of my previous relationships didn&#39;t.</p><p>I love a lot of solitary activities, like reading, writing, single-player games, drawing and painting, learning new things, working on projects that she isn&#39;t interested in, etc. Without my self-imposed rule, I would likely decline to do a lot of other activities, especially outside my own interests.</p><p>But if she wants to do something or go somewhere or just sit and talk, then I say yes.</p><p>My kids are young enough that I don&#39;t quite have the same rule with them, and partly because they just want me to do stuff with them and be with them <i>literally all the time</i>, so we are still in boundary-setting phase, but I assume that I will eventually adopt the &#34;as you wish&#34; rule with them as well.

I need to take action and organise something to do with her. And also take initiative to organise things with other friends. Sadly, those friends don&#39;t seem to follow this &#34;as you wish&#34; rule.

It is a completely different game if offers happen very rarely.  In my case, I&#39;ve got yet another challenge: I have a disability.  And people tend to treat you like sfrm another star.  It is really quite a challenge to stay connected if society treats you like an outcast.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Grown-up recreational sports are nothing like the (often hostile) world of sports you might remember as a kid. Generally very supportive places. Co-ed leagues tend to be more easygoing. If you&#39;re a beginner, pay for some lessons. For example... <i>lots</i> of tennis coaches out there. If you are healthy enough to move around you can learn to play a pretty decent game of tennis in not much time and with less $$$ than you&#39;d spend on a new Xbox.

Of course that doesn’t work out too well when you’re married.</p><p>I had to actually start purposefully keeping in touch with friends and former coworkers as I changed jobs every couple of years and when I saw an old high school classmate (from over 20 years ago) that I was “friends” with on Facebook, I made an effort to reach out to him and another classmate to meet for drinks.

I spent a lot of lonely time in my 20s living alone and working from home.  One thing is to live in a shared house.  That is a way to have people to live with.  It worked for me to not be as lonely at times in my adulthood.<p>The other thing is to get involved with social physical activity, clubs, or volunteering.  I played hockey and went to a group fitness gym.  I made long term friends there.  I am into ham radio and the club where I live is pretty good. I used to volunteer at a kids camp and that was great for making friends with the staff members and doing social things outside of camp.</p><p>To me, find where your interests align with social/community activity.  Currently, I am trying to get the ham radio club to be more out in the community.  We are doing radio communications for a running race this weekend.  It is exciting.

You won’t have any idea what you’re doing for the first month or two, but I think it’s healthy to get humbled once in a while.</p><p>California (specifically So Cal) is kind of the Mecca of BJJ in the US, so a gym should be easy to find. Give it a try everyone.

Most shops organize group rides at all skill levels, and most cities have bike groups.  It&#39;s a wildly social sport, and most rides end at cafes or breweries.

I went to a &#34;bring your own art&#34; event in SF a couple weeks ago that was a public event on Facebook. I took a photography work I had made. I took a robot I had built to Maker Faire. For tech projects, email event organizers, meetup organizers and ask if you can present at their next event. For art projects consider sharing a unique or interesting story or journey, not just a single piece of art. If you actually do make something cool or you have a good story, you&#39;ll be surprised how easy it is to get a few yeses.</p><p>When you are the creator/presenter/speaker, you meet people quickly because it&#39;s not awkward for others to approach you and ask questions. It&#39;s a lot harder to meet people as a mere participant.</p><p>Seeking out events you can present or exhibit at is not that easy for everyone. But since you&#39;re in Providence, you should be able to find plenty of events an hour away in Boston.</p><p>Also, if you have a hard time finding events but you have a critical mass of a few friends in the area, consider hosting an event. It can be as simple as a potluck, which means you basically have to do no work except maybe make 1 dish yourself and clean up afterwards. Let your friends know it&#39;s okay to bring +1 or +2. Many times they will. You&#39;ll meet a lot of new people that way too.

Just like pornographic movies affect one&#39;s love life, seeing unrealistic depictions of social life destroy natural curiosity about other people, lead to doubts and suspicions etc. ... The availability of the option to avoid other people does its part.

An other is that women get treatment more than men, particularly for depression. Treatment greatly reduce the risk of completed suicide.<p>There is a large uncomfortable area within suicide data. In a study, about half who attempt suicide said it was a cry for help. While we can&#39;t ask those that die, we do have data that say that those people usually have both a history of suicide attempts and a lack of treatment for it. This combination has a gendered aspect.</p><p>So it can be firearms, the culture around treatment, both, or other aspects which explains why men die by suicide 3.54x more often than women while at the same time women attempt suicide 1.2x more than men.</p><p>I think the best action to reduce suicide is with the medical profession. Treatment of drug and alcohol addiction, depression, and those who have attempted suicide in the past. We can try to reduce the number of firearms and adding barriers on bridges and subway platforms, but I have my doubts that areas which implement such action actually see a reduction in completed suicides. At best it gives the health care system a bit more time to provide treatment.

Depending a bit on who you ask the wast majority of suicides is caused by untreated mental or emotional disorders, most commonly depression. A untreated disease which definition is the inability to feel happy and recover from feeling sad seems quite relevant in the context of suicide, and when we know there is a difference in treatment and see a difference in outcomes then that should be our first stop in our logical conclusions.

The data show a clear difference in how women and men die from suicide.<p>What is discussed is the cause for it. The theory smells that men are violent thus they choose violent methods and women are vain and thus choose vain methods. It just conveniently fit our gender stereotypes perfectly which should be a rather big red flag for anyone looking at social science with a critical view.</p><p>There are several contending theories. To the degree that suicide attempts are a cry for help the difference in how society react towards men and women likely impacts the method of choice. An other theory is convenience where more women get opioids prescriptions then men, while more men are involved in activities with high gun ownership.</p><p>There are more. Gender differences in mental health, differences in alcohol consumption, and difference in social support networks are all additional suspects in explaining why we see a gender difference in outcomes and methods.</p><p>One of the data point that looks a bit odd is that even if we account of difference in method, men are about 60% more likely to still die in the attempt. As far as I know this difference is still there for methods like self-poisoning which is the most &#34;preferred&#34; method for women. Unless we want to go into the bucket of stereotypes again and simply state that men are more competent with suicide regardless of method it seems like we should entertain the idea of other causes for gender differences.

&#34;For men, the most common method is hanging (首つり, 69.3%), followed by jumping (飛降り, 8.8%), and suffocation by burning charcoal or a similar substance (練炭等, 7.3%), and for women the most common method is hanging (59.8%), followed by jumping (14.2%) and drowning (入水, 6.3%).&#34;</p><p>For both sexes, jumping appears to be significantly more common for children under 19 than other groups. Train jumping (飛込み) is much less common than you might think, but is common for the &#34;age undermined&#34; (不詳) group (men 14.3%, women 42.9%), presumably because the remains are hard to identify.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/wp/hakusyo/jisatsu/18/dl/1-6.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.mhlw.go.jp/wp/hakusyo/jisatsu/18/dl/1-6.pdf</a> (page 30)

Moreover Tinder has economic incentives to keep you on their platform, swiping, texting, paying subscription fees, and viewing ads, all things you stop doing when you meet people and enter into a committed relationship.</p><p>Most social networks unfortunately follow this model; they have monetary incentives to keep you as engaged as possible in their all digital, all the time lifestyle, rather than unplugging and physically sharing space with other humans.</p><p>Healthier business models can certainly be imagined and maybe they&#39;ll even be implemented someday, but they aren&#39;t prevalent right now.
