<b>All geocaching tools a geocacher needs in one box!</b>
From coordinate notation changes to conversions to complete different coordinate systems and from distance calculations to midpoint and intersection calculations can be found here. All results will be shown on the map as a reference, next save them as .gpx or send them directly to your GPS device. With Geocaching Live support it is also possible to import coordinates of geocaches and waypoints from Geocaching.com directly into the different tools and update your personal cache note with the result.<br/>But there is more, also word value, caesar cipher, vigen√®re cipher, morse code and lots more!</p>
