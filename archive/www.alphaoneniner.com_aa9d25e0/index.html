<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span><em>When the AON Evade was first launched as the Recon 9, a 21L backpack, it quickly became a popular crowdsourced choice. Over time, it evolved into the 2.0 (30L) and the recent 1.5 (25L), but now, it has come full circle back to its original 21L size in the form of our first Evade 1.0X.</em></span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span><em>Product development is a collaborative effort, and the Evade 1.0X represents a significant step forward thanks to the valuable feedback from existing Evade owners and the dedicated contributions of remarkable individuals and collaborators…………..our dear friends and esteemed industry pros, David Valencic and Brandon Vulaj.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>But what does the &#34;X&#34; signify?</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>The &#34;X&#34; commemorates the brand&#39;s 10th anniversary, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of our parent company, SERT. During its initial decade, AON was dedicated to creating products based on crowdsourced ideas and feedback. Our foundation in law enforcement and military gear production remained an integral part of this process. However, what&#39;s lesser-known is my personal background in the fashion industry, where I spent nearly 20 years contributing to prestigious brands like Armani, Kenzo, Comme des Garcons, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Karl Lagerfeld and DKNY (my first product development gig).</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>As we celebrate AON&#39;s 10th anniversary, we&#39;re proud to unveil the X series, starting with the Evade 1.0X. This time, together with assistance from Brandon &amp; David, we&#39;re infusing my personal fashion sensibilities into the designs, merging what I think is the best of both worlds.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Warm regards.......HELM</em></span></p>
