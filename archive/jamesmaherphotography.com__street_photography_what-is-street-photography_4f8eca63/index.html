Obviously, some places like New York will be much easier to do this than others, but that shouldn’t stop you.</p> <p><strong>Before you start, think about what you will say if someone catches you.</strong> When I get caught, I smile, tell the person that yes, I did take their photo, I’m doing a project on the streets and people of New York, and I thought they looked fabulous. Flattery is key. Offer to email them the photograph, and if they still seem uncomfortable, then offer to delete it.</p> <p><strong>If you handle yourself in this manner, you will find it so much easier and sometimes enjoyable when you get caught.</strong></p> <p>The next step is to go somewhere busy. You shouldn’t only photograph in busy places, but when you are learning this can be very important. <strong>Go to a busy street corner, a fair, or an event where lots of interesting things are happening, and you will find that you and your camera will fit right in.</strong> When there are lots of people with cameras around and everyone is happy and busy, you will find that people will barely notice you.</p> <p>This is an environment that will allow you to get comfortable with your camera so that you can learn how to take good shots.</p>  <p><img alt="New York Street Photography" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTQ3Njo3MjM=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new-york-street-photography-2-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p><strong>Similarly, sometimes you will want to pick a spot and let your subjects come to you.</strong> Find a location where a lot is going on and spend your energy watching your surroundings instead of walking around.</p> <p>Keep your camera up and ready to shoot, and watch people as they come closer to you. This way they will be entering your personal space instead of you entering their space, and they will not notice you as much. You will also be quicker to react since you will already be in the right spot and watching your surroundings intently.</p> <p><strong>A quick note:</strong> It is common for people to start off by shooting mostly from the hip – that is, photographing without putting the camera to their eye to make it much less noticeable. This is a practice that a lot of photographers do, including me some of the time. Sometimes it’s necessary, but it can be a crutch as well.</p> <p><strong>Learn to shoot by putting the camera to your eye at first.</strong> Shoot from the hip if and when necessary, but get that camera up to your eye as often as you can.</p> <p>And if you still find yourself struggling with aspects of <a href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/candid-street-photography/">candid street photography</a>, try some <a href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/street-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street portraits</a> first to get comfortable. This can be a great transition once you realize how receptive people are to having their portrait taken.</p>  <h2>Acting</h2> <p><img alt="Acting in Street Photography" width="350" height="525" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-6.jpg 350w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-6-240x360.jpg 240w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-6.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTQ4NDo1MDQ=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-6.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-6.jpg 350w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-6-240x360.jpg 240w"/>Some of the best street photographers are also the best actors when photographing. They have a way of looking like they are tourists or that they have no idea how to use their camera. The confused, in their own world, or dense looks that I have seen on some photographers’ faces have been hilarious.</p> <p>One photographer I know will even go right up and take a photo of someone, and then when they look up, he will say, “Oh, I was just testing my camera. Sorry about that!”</p> <p>Usually, it will be more subtle than that, but <strong>it will help to do some light acting so that the moments can be as candid as possible and so you will not have to deal with everyone stopping to ask if you took their photo.</strong> You would get nowhere if that was the case.</p> <p>Also, try to keep from making eye contact with people as that has an evolutionary way of getting their attention. Always look off to the side, above, or through them.</p> <p><strong>The camera snap is a fantastic technique to use.</strong> Your natural instinct will be to remove the camera from your eye the second you take a photograph. Nearly everyone does this, and this is how people know you have taken their photo.</p> <p><strong>Instead, capture the photo and keep the camera to your eye as the person moves out of your scene.</strong> This will have them thinking that you are just photographing the background and that they got in your way. Similarly, you can aim your camera above or to the side of a person like you are photographing the background and then at the last second point the camera at them, take the photo, and move on.</p>  <h2>Use your eyes</h2> <p><img alt="Learn Street Photography" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTQ5Mjo3MTk=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-8-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>This may seem like such a simple tip, but it’s not. So many photographers that I have taught seem glued to their camera the entire time, and that can stop you from noticing your surroundings. <strong>When done well, it almost feels like the camera isn’t even there.</strong></p> <p>To find a great moment, you actually have to see it with your eyes before you go to take a shot, so embrace this. Focus your energy on looking around and try to be as aware of your surroundings as possible.</p>  <h2>Get closer</h2> <p><img alt="Get closer in street photography" width="332" height="500" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-9-1.jpg 332w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-9-1-239x360.jpg 239w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-9-1.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTQ5Nzo1MTQ=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-9-1.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-9-1.jpg 332w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-9-1-239x360.jpg 239w"/>This is not meant to be a blanket statement, but a common problem is that photographers do not get close enough. Fill the frame with your scene and get close enough to your subjects to be able to notice the little details. But also keep in mind that you can get too close.</p> <p>Some photographers take this tip too much to heart, and every photograph is a close-up face or detail without any context or background at all. <strong>Use some balance, but remember that being part of the action instead of lurking far away will improve the quality of your photos.</strong></p>  <h2>Be spontaneous</h2> <p>Moments in street photography happen so fast. So many photographs will appear and disappear before you even put the camera to your eye.</p> <p><strong>This makes it vital to go with your gut.</strong> If you feel the potential for a photograph, take it. Often, this will result in a terrible photograph, but when you get a successful one, it will be that much more interesting. Get loose and embrace your instincts.</p>  <h2>Emotion and gesture</h2> <p><img alt="Emotion and Gesture in Street Photography" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTUwNTo3NDE=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-10-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>Give me a photograph of a normal-looking person with a powerful expression any day over the most interestingly dressed person with a boring expression.</p> <p><strong>As photographers, we are looking for ideas and emotions in our images</strong>, and a primary way to do that is to capture those emotions in people’s faces, the looks in their eyes, or the gestures in their bodies.

You do not need to go to a different place each time to get a great photograph.</p> <p><strong>You can get a great photograph anywhere</strong>, and you should practice in places that you might think of as typically uninteresting or boring. The term boring is actually quite interesting. Why do you think the area is boring or will not be a good location for photography?</p> <p>Go to a parking lot, a suburb, or a quiet street and see what you can do there. Some of the most incredible street photographs have been taken in these environments.</p>  <h2>Street photography cameras and equipment</h2> <p><img alt="Street Photography Equipment" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTUxNzo3Mjg=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-12-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>Interested in a camera for street photography? Check out this article – <a href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/street-photography-cameras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/street-photography-cameras/">The Best Digital Cameras for Street Photography</a>.</p> <p>It is commonly said that you can do street photography with any camera, and while this is true, <strong>some cameras will give you a significant advantage.</strong> SLRs are fast but they can be very large, and it becomes difficult to be quick and spontaneous with one. If you must use an SLR (and I used one for over 10 years for street photography, so don’t feel bad), grab a light <a href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/best-lens-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prime lens such as a 35mm or 50mm</a> (the two most popular lenses used by street photographers).</p> <p><strong>Prime lenses will lighten your camera and make it much less noticeable.</strong> In addition, getting used to a single focal length will have a profound effect on your photography.</p> <p><strong>You have to let go of the fact that you will lose out on some shots because you don’t have a zoom lens</strong>. That will happen, but you will make up for this by becoming so used to the prime lens and focal length and so fast with it, that you will be able to capture more spontaneous images. This will help focus you and it will help you become more consistent.</p> <p><strong>I highly suggest mirrorless cameras or even micro 4/3rds cameras.</strong> My recommended cameras are either the <a href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/fuji-x100-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuji X100</a> series or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084ZTV3QK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B084ZTV3QK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jamemahephot-20&amp;linkId=68107bc479b3670d02352cb4df7e959d">X-T</a> line. Fuji has the quality and design factor that no other camera other than Leica has right now, and they are about a fifth of the price. Olympus, Ricoh, and Sony all make good smaller form cameras as well, but keep in mind that some of the Sony lenses are so huge that it will make the mirrorless camera feel like an SLR.</p> <p>Many people even do street photography with a camera phone. Camera phones have come a long way and you can do great work with one. If you can’t take your camera with you, don’t hesitate to take a photography break with your phone.</p>  <h2>Camera settings</h2> <p><img alt="Street Photography Cameras" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTUyNjo3MjY=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-13-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>Now for the fun part. Knowing your <a href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/what-are-the-best-street-photography-camera-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camera settings for street photography</a> is necessary, and I suggest shooting in either Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, or Manual mode. Unless you are very good, Manual can be tough in many lighting situations, particularly for sunny days when you will be shooting in the sunlight one second and in the shade in another.</p> <p><strong>I prefer to use a shutter speed of 1/250th or faster.</strong> This number will guarantee that the motion in your subjects will be frozen. You can stop down to 1/160th, 1/125th, or even 1/60th at night or with people who are not moving, but there is a higher chance of motion blur if they are.</p> <p><strong>This is a personal preference, but I also like to shoot with as small an aperture as possible.</strong> Yes, bokeh can be beautiful, but with a small aperture (large depth of field), it allows me a better chance of getting my subjects sharp.</p> <p>If you miss the focus with a large depth of field, there is still a good chance the shot will be saved. In addition, a large depth of field helps when you have multiple subjects at different depths or an important background that you also want to be relatively sharp. Context is very important in street photography, so I like to have my backgrounds relatively sharp.</p>  <p><img alt="Street Photography Cameras" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTUzMjo3MjY=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-26-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>When photographing with a fast shutter speed and small aperture, not much light will hit the sensor, so unless you are in bright sunlight, something has to give, <strong>and that is the ISO</strong>. Newer cameras create gorgeous photographs at higher ISOs, so you shouldn’t be afraid to raise it up. There will be more grain, but your shots will be sharper and of a higher quality that will more than offset this.</p> <p>And that grain can be beautiful! <strong>I like to shoot at ISO 400 in sunlight, 800-1600 in shade, and 3200-6400 at dusk and night.</strong></p> <p>I do not recommend using auto-ISO unless you are in Manual mode. You only want the camera to choose one of the three settings.</p> <p>In evening, indoors, or in very dark situations, I will often shoot in Shutter Priority mode to guarantee that I have a fast enough shutter speed to freeze motion. <strong>During daylight, I will usually shoot in Aperture Priority.</strong> I usually only shoot in Manual at night or if the light is very even. However, you can use any of these modes to the same effect if you know them well.</p>  <h2>Advanced Tips</h2> <p><img alt="Street Photography Tips" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTUzOTo3MjM=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-29-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>While the previous photography examples had more differences between them, take notice that the examples going forward will be much more consistent in content and look.

This is why grain works very well in street photography.

Is there direct light, a hazy backlight, artificial light, reflected light, or are there pockets of light shining through? Are there beautiful shadows? How is the light hitting your main subject and background?</p> <p>You can do some very interesting things with light once you learn to notice it.</p> <p><img alt="Street Photography Composition" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTU1NDo3MzA=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-27-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>Since street photographs appear so quickly, composition is often done spontaneously and instinctually, so this is where the practice comes in. <strong>As we just mentioned with the imperfections, you can get away with a lot more than you can in traditional landscape photography.</strong></p> <p>Skewed horizons or strange compositions can make the photograph feel real and can go a long way, but it depends on the photograph. <strong>Think of composition as you would for a breathtaking landscape</strong>, but instead of a boulder there is a fire hydrant, instead of a stream there is some spilled coffee, or instead of a mountain there is a ladder. Use these everyday elements in the same manner.</p> <p><strong>Great compositional photographers have a way of leading people’s eyes around an image</strong>, and they use these everyday elements to do it. Every aspect of your photograph is important, including what you put in the corners. A viewer’s eyes will naturally be drawn off of your photograph, and your corners will keep their eyes from leaving the picture. This will make it feel more balanced.</p> <p><strong>In addition, try not to get hyper-focused on just your main subject</strong>. If you see a great element for a photograph, always look around to see if it is possible to combine it with other interesting elements to create a more complex scene.</p>  <h2>Take photos for yourself</h2> <p><img alt="Street Photography: Take Photos for Yourself" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTU2MTo3NDQ=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-16-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p><strong>Try not to worry about how other people will perceive your work.</strong> Street photographs can be weird, and not everyone will understand them or like them.

768w"/></p> <p>Zone focusing is the king of all technical skills for street photographers. <strong>It is the practice of setting your camera to manual focus and using focusing distances to your advance.</strong> Some cameras will have a focus distance meter on their lens or in their viewfinder, and this helps immensely.</p> <p>I typically set my focus distance to around 8 to 10 feet, although in very busy situations such as rush hour on a busy corner, I will set it to 5-6 feet – but the closer in, the more exact you have to be with the focus.</p> <p>You then need to photograph your subjects when they are in the range that your camera is focused for, so you will have to learn your distances (i.e. how far 10 feet away is). <strong>Because of depth of field, zone focusing is much easier with a wide-angle lens</strong>, so I typically only do it with a 35mm lens and sometimes with a 50mm lens in bright sunlight.</p>  <p><img alt="Street Photography Focusing" width="900"

will start off with a 35mm lens using F8 to F16.</strong></p> <p>With a wide-angle lens and F11 for instance, if you are focused at 10 feet, most of your scene will be sharp. Subjects at 7 feet will be pretty sharp and the background will be pretty sharp, so this gives you a lot of flexibility in how you can shoot. And the most important factor here is that you don’t have to spend the time locking in the focus, so this will make you that much more quick and spontaneous.</p> <p>See this article for a more in-depth guide to <a href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/zone-focusing-street-photography/">zone focusing</a>. Zone focusing is not hard to do well, but it takes a little practice at first, so be prepared to screw up most of your photographs the first time around.</p>  <h2>Projects and sequencing</h2> <p><img alt="Street Photography Projects and Sequencing" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTU4OTo3NDI=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-21-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>As you improve and build up more and more of an archive, you will start to notice more consistency in your work. You will start to think of themes, ideas, and projects. <strong>This is why editing time is so important for street photography.</strong> By spending time with your photographs, you will understand yourself and your work better, and it will help inform what you shoot when you go out.</p> <p>Search through your work and split them up into different ideas. Continue to move around the sequence of the photos to play around with these ideas and add to them over time. <strong>Plan for these ideas to take a lot of time to grow, and many of them will happen organically.</strong> A project you think of one year in might completely transform by year three.</p> <p>The photos you see in this section are part of a project called <a href="https://jamesmaherphotography.com/luxe-city/">Luxe City</a>, which is about the changing nature of New York, the gentrification, the loss of interaction and loneliness, and the suburban cleansing of the city. It took time to truly understand what I was trying to create with this project.</p> <p>Editing is where you figure out what you are doing, so make sure to spend a lot of time with it.</p>  <h2>An ethics and law primer</h2> <p><img alt="Street Photography ethics and laws" width="900" height="603" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2-600x402.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2-537x360.jpg 537w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2-768x515.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTU5Njo3Mjk=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2-600x402.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2-537x360.jpg 537w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-2-768x515.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>Always look up your local laws regarding street photography, as I am not a lawyer. <strong>However, street photography is legal in the United States as long as you use the pictures for artistic purposes.</strong> You can sell prints of them, use them in online articles, and show them in books as you would a piece of art, but you cannot use them for commercial or advertising purposes.</p> <p>Many countries have similar laws to the U.S., but in some, it is illegal to do street photography without permission from the person you are photographing – which makes it difficult if you are trying to capture a candid photograph. Some photographers get tricky, by making sure their streets shots only have people who are unrecognizable, while others disregard these laws and go on like normal. Make sure you do your own research before you decide on what to do.</p> <p>The ethic of street photography is another story. Is it ethical to photograph strangers in public without their permission? That depends on how you feel. <strong>I think these images are important for cultural, artistic, and historical purposes, and I believe I am a good person doing good things</strong>, but occasionally I will still feel creepy taking photos of people in public. It can be creepy, but it is what it is, and to me, it’s worth it.</p> <p>Some photographers will not photograph children or homeless people, while other photographers do incredible and very compassionate work with children and homeless people. The point is to figure out what you are comfortable with and go with that. Don’t let anyone else tell you what is ethically right or wrong.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p><img alt="Street Photography Tips and Techniques" width="900" height="600" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22-768x512.jpg 768w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MTYwMzo3Mzg=-1" src="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22.jpg 900w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22-540x360.jpg 540w, https://cdn-ffcgi.nitrocdn.com/ZhDYBbXPoHrCHvLPGOdQmXKAjZXwoPng/assets/images/optimized/rev-2a8ff33/jamesmaherphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_york_street_photography-22-768x512.jpg 768w"/></p> <p>This is a lot to absorb at first, so keep this article and come back to it over time.
