            <p>It honestly made more of a difference than I thought it would. My hands are much more comfortable while I&#39;m playing and after I&#39;m done. I bought it because of one game that was causing me to grip my switch harder than normal but it has been great for every other game that I play too. I would never go back to playing my switch without this grip now.</p>

            <p>A must have for switch lite! Comfy and secure and no more numb hands. GREAT ergonomics on this thing. That&#39;s what she said</p>

            <p>The grip is great, perfect! The only reason why I&#39;m not giving it 5 stars is because the handle can become kind of sticky?</p>

            <p>My experience is good! I searched for a grip and this one seemed to be reviewed the best and competitive in price with all the others that looked worse. I am happily surprised with the build quality and attention to detail. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you for making such a product at an affordable price. Very recommended for anyone who owns a switch. It definitely gives you a better grip than the console itself and it&#39;s more comfortable to hold.</p>

            <p>Great feeling grip. Its now a staple for when I use my switch. Very comfortable on the hands and it allows for natural hand placement so they don&#39;t cramp up or fall asleep while playing. Good quality and keeps the switch from rubbing against plastic with its float design. </p>
