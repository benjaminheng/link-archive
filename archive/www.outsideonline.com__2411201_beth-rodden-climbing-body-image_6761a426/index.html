      <p>When I was 14 years old, I went on my first climbing trip to the Sierra with a man in his late twenties, a mentor of mine. We piled into his small pickup truck, smashed between ropes and climbing gear.</p>
<p>Above the rearview mirror was a little sign that read “Baked Goods.” The words were circled and had an X through them.</p>
<p>I thought it was weird that anyone would hate baked goods, but I was thankful to be there, so I didn’t say anything. We stopped at a bagel shop to fuel up. I was a late-blooming child, and food was simple to me back then: you eat when you are hungry and play the rest of the time. I ordered two bagels with extra cream cheese and consumed them before we left the parking lot. I barely felt full after I finished.</p>
<p>“You aren’t going to climb anything after those bagels, Rodden,” he laughed. “That’s like two days’ worth of calories.”</p>
<p>I had no idea what he was talking about, but I felt ashamed and dumb, like I didn’t know an important rule of climbing, or eating. The seed was planted.</p>
<p>Two years later, in a crowded stadium after a World Cup competition, one of my climbing heroes told me that she lost five pounds before every competition, then gained the weight back afterward. I started losing weight before comps, too, only I didn’t gain it back afterward. Weight loss, I decided, was a path to the podium.</p>
<p>One of the problems was: it worked. At least I thought it did. I made the podium at World Cups and won the Junior National Championships four years in a row, but I couldn’t celebrate my success because I was busy comparing myself to my peers. No one ever explicitly told me to lose weight, but in my mind, being thin equaled<strong> </strong>success. So I scrutinized how my competitors looked and what they ate or didn’t eat. I wanted to match or better them.</p>
<p>My thighs were skinnier than my knees until my late teens. I didn’t get my <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2186466/what-really-happens-when-runners-lose-their-periods">period</a> until I was 19. When I finally did, I felt like a failure—it meant I was gaining<strong> </strong>weight.</p>
<p>The climbers I saw in magazines were desperately skinny and usually scantily clad. I started to notice that most of my peers and competitors could still wear children’s clothing. I scoped out people’s teeth and tried to guess who threw up.<strong> </strong>My eating became so stringent that I would go to bed hungry every night and only feel comfortable eating prepackaged and preportioned<strong> </strong>meals, so I knew exactly how many calories I was consuming.</p>

<p>Sadly, my behavior was only rewarded. I performed better, and I got more sponsorships with each competition won. I was featured in movies or advertisements for first ascents and barriers that I broke. It was a win-at-all-costs system that, at the time, I was happy to be a part of. And it seemed that the culture was happy to have me there, as long as I was performing. I felt in control and empowered to manipulate my body to achieve the impossible.</p>
<p>But as I got older, nature took over. At some point, I no longer weighed as much as a child. I felt like an elephant as I matured. I started getting my period regularly. I moved from an extra-small climbing harness to a small one. Women’s bodies change. While men just seem to get stronger, our center of gravity shifts. We get hips and breasts. I felt that I was losing my edge.</p>
<p>I transitioned away from competition and toward big walls and hard traditional climbing. But one thing that didn’t change was my eating or how I felt about my body. I was ashamed of it. I pined to have a six-pack and muscular arms so I would “look good” in a sports bra.</p>
<p>At the time, I was married to professional climber <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tommycaldwell/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tommy Caldwell</a>. At almost every photo shoot, I’d be asked to take off my shirt. Tommy was able to leave his on. “Can you suck in your stomach, Beth?” the photographer would ask. I hated wearing a sports bra without a shirt.</p>
<p>This was the same era when I established <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/107161194/meltdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meltdown</a>, a 5.14c crack at Yosemite<strong> </strong>that would take over a decade to be repeated—by a man or a woman. It was the hardest trad climb ever established by a woman, and here I was, worried that my stomach was too big.</p>
<p>In my late twenties, after a decade of pushing the limits of climbing, my body <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2238956/condition-thats-quietly-sidelining-female-athletes" target="_self" rel="noopener">started to break down</a>. Tendons, ligaments, bones—they all started to collapse after 15 years of deprivation. My climbing cascaded from elite to elementary in a matter of months. Depressed and<strong> </strong>harboring self-harmful thoughts, I gained weight. I’d overhear people say, “What happened to Beth? She’s really let herself go.” Unable to perform, my pay was understandably cut. I felt like damaged goods.</p>

<p>I almost gave up climbing. I completely lost sight of why I’d started in the first place: because I loved it, and it was fun. Fortunately, with time and a lot of work and understanding about what is truly healthy, I rediscovered that climbing was not and should not be a send-at-all-costs culture. It required changing my inner dialogue and changing who I interacted with, both in person and online, and learning to walk away from unhealthy conversations. I had to normalize normal. It took years.</p>
<p>Losing weight worked for my short-term performance gains but was extremely harmful in the long run. We need to start celebrating a culture that values sustainability, longevity, and health.<strong> </strong>It’s time to let go of the unrealistic expectations of what our bodies should look like.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean we have to lower our standards of what’s possible in climbing. Last year I went back to El Poussif, a boulder problem in France’s Fontainebleau Forest that I hadn’t tried since 2003. It’s everything I love about climbing: technical and subtle and requiring you to be strong and smart to be successful. When I first tried it, I naively thought I would do it quickly. But I got shut down, hard. When I returned 15 pounds heavier, I assumed I was set up for a similar spectacular failure. But I tried to silence those thoughts. I had been climbing well, better, in fact, than I had since before having my son, and was starting to realize that maybe weight isn’t the only path to success. I always thought my previously leaner body would be higher performing, but I had never done a direct comparison. After a few hours, I stood on top of the climb, elated. El Poussif showed me that I could climb hard—harder even than before—with a heavier body, a healthier body.</p>
<p>This year I started climbing in just a sports bra again. It’s been five years since I had my son, and I was tired of waiting for my prepregnancy body to come back. I am heavier and softer than I’ve ever been, but I no longer feel the need to suck in my stomach for the camera. I know that representation matters, and that a simple act like proudly baring a soft belly in a distorted culture can make a huge difference. I hope that all climbers—men, women, young and old—can see examples of all body types being celebrated in climbing. I hope that the climbing community can change.</p>
