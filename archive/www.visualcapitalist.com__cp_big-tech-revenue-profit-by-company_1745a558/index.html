                                            <div id="mvp-content-main">
                                                <p>In the media and public discourse, companies like Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft are often lumped together into the same “Big Tech” category. After all, they constitute the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-biggest-companies-in-the-world-in-2021/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">world’s largest companies</a> by market capitalization.</p>
<p>And because of this, it’s easy to assume they’re in direct competition with each other, fiercely battling for a bigger piece of the “<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-tech-giants-worth-compared-economies-countries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Big Tech</a>” pie. But while there is certainly competition between the world’s tech giants, it’s a lot less drastic than you might imagine. </p>
<p>This is apparent when you look into their various revenue streams, and this series of graphics by <strong>Truman Du</strong> provides a revenue breakdown of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.</p>
<h2>How Big Tech Companies Generate Revenue</h2>
<p>So how does each big tech firm make money? Let’s explore using data from each company’s June 2022 quarterly income statements.</p>
<h4>Alphabet</h4>
<p><img src="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Alphabet-Revenue-June-2022-1200.png" alt="breakdown of Alphabet&#39;s revenue streams and profit" width="820"/></p>
<p>View the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Alphabet-Revenue-June-2022-full-size.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full-size</a> infographic</p>
<p>In Q2 2022, about <strong>72%</strong> of Alphabet’s revenue came from search advertising. This makes sense considering Google and YouTube get a lot of eyeballs. Google dominates the search market—about <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/this-chart-reveals-googles-true-dominance-over-the-web/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">90%</a> of all internet searches are done on Google platforms. </p>
<h4>Amazon</h4>
<p><img src="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Amazon-Revenue-June-2022-1200.png" alt="breakdown of amazon&#39;s revenue streams and profit" width="820"/></p>
<p>View the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Amazon-Revenue.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full-size</a> infographic</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Amazon’s biggest revenue driver is e-commerce. However, as the graphic above shows, the costs of e-commerce are so steep, that it actually reported a net loss in Q2 2022. </p>
<p>As it <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/aws-powering-the-internet-and-amazons-profits/">often is</a>, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the company’s main profit-earner this quarter. </p>
<h4>Apple</h4>
<p><img src="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Revenue-June-2022-1200.png" alt="breakdown of Apple&#39;s revenue streams and profit" width="820"/></p>
<p>View the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Apple-Revenue.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full-size</a> infographic</p>
<p>Apple’s biggest revenue driver is consumer electronics sales, particularly from the iPhone which accounts for nearly half of overall revenue. iPhones are particularly popular in the U.S., where they make up around <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/iphone-majority-us-smartphones/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">50%</a> of smartphone sales across the country. </p>
<p>Besides devices, services like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+ also generate revenue for the company. But in Q2 2022, Apple’s services branch accounted for only 24% of the company’s overall revenue.</p>
<h4>Microsoft</h4>
<p><img src="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Microsoft-Revenue-June-2022-1200.png" alt="breakdown of Microsoft&#39;s revenue streams and profit" width="820"/></p>
<p>View the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Microsoft-Revenue.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full-size</a> infographic</p>
<p>Microsoft has a fairly even split between its various revenue sources, but similarly to Amazon its biggest revenue driver is its cloud services platform, Azure. </p>
<p>After AWS, Azure is the second largest cloud server in the world, capturing <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">21%</a> of the global cloud infrastructure market.</p>

<p>From Sputnik 1 to today’s massive satellite constellations, every object in space was launched from just a handful of locations.</p>
<p>The map above, from <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BryceTech</a>, is a comprehensive look at the world’s spaceports (both orbital and sub-orbital) as well as ballistic missile test sites.</p>
<p>
ℹ️ <span>In sub-orbital spaceflight, a spacecraft reaches outer space, but it doesn’t complete an orbital revolution or reach escape velocity. In orbital spaceflight, a spacecraft remains in space for at least one orbit.</span>
</p>
<h2>The World’s Major Spaceports</h2>
<p>Though the graphic above is a detailed list of many types of rocket launch sites, we’ll focus on major sites that are sending satellites and passengers into sub-orbit, orbit, and beyond.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: The above table includes all sites that are operational, as well as under construction, as of publishing date.</em></p>
<p>The list above covers fixed locations, and does not include SpaceX’s autonomous spaceport drone ships. There are currently three active drone ships—one based near Los Angeles, and the other two based at Port Canaveral, Florida.</p>
<p>Two of the most famous launch sites on the list are the <strong>Baikonur Cosmodrome</strong> (Kazakhstan) and <strong>Cape Canaveral</strong> (United States). The former was constructed as the base of operations for the Soviet space program and was the launch point for Earth’s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. The latter was NASA’s primary base of operations and the first lunar-landing flight was launched from there in 1969.</p>
<p>The global roster of spaceports has <a href="https://aerospace.csis.org/data/spaceports-of-the-world/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">grown immensely</a> since Baikonur and Cape Canaveral were the only game in town. Now numerous countries have the ability to launch satellites, and many more are getting in on the action.</p>
<p><strong>Wenchang Space Launch Site</strong>, on the island of Hainan, is China’s newest launch location. The site recorded its first successful launch in 2016.</p>
<h2>Location, Location</h2>
<p>One interesting quirk of the map above is the lack of spaceports in Europe. Europe’s ambitions for space are actually launched from the <strong>Guiana Space Centre</strong> in South America. Europe’s Spaceport has been operating in French Guiana since 1968.</p>
<p>Low altitude launch locations near the equator are the most desirable, as far less energy is required to take a spacecraft from surface level to an equatorial, geostationary orbit.</p>
<p>Islands and coastal areas are also common locations for launch sites. Since the open waters aren’t inhabited, there is minimal risk of harm from debris in the event of a launch failure.</p>
<p>As demand for satellites and space exploration grows, the number of launch locations will continue to grow as well. </p>

                                                            <h2>Ranked: The World’s Most Surveilled Cities</h2>
<p>This may come as a surprise, but it wasn’t until 2007 that the global urban population overtook the rural population. At that time, the two groups were split nearly 50/50, with around 3.3 billion people apiece.</p>
<p>Today, the percentage of people living in urban areas has grown to over <strong>55%</strong>, and is expected to reach <strong>68%</strong> by 2050. Due to this trend, many of the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/most-populous-cities-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world’s largest cities</a> have become home to tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>In response to such incredible density, governments, businesses, and households have installed countless security cameras for various purposes including crime protection. To grasp the scale of this surveillance, we’ve taken data from a recent report by <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/vpn-privacy/the-worlds-most-surveilled-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comparitech</a> to visualize the most surveilled cities in the world.</p>
<h2>The List (Excluding China)</h2>
<p>Excluding China for the time being, these are the world’s 10 most surveilled cities.</p>

<p><em>Figures rounded</em></p>
<p>The top four cities all belong to <strong>India</strong>, which is the world’s second largest country by population. Surveillance cameras are playing a major role in the country’s efforts to reduce crimes against women.</p>
<p>Further down the list are cities from a variety of countries. One of these is <strong>Russia</strong>, which has expanded its use of surveillance cameras in recent years. Given the country’s <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track record</a> of human rights violations, activists are worried that facial recognition technology could become a tool of oppression.</p>
<p>The only U.S. city on the list is <strong>Los Angeles</strong>, which contains some of the country’s wealthiest neighborhoods and municipalities. That includes Beverly Hills, which according to the Los Angeles Times, has over 2,000 cameras for its population of 32,500. That translates to about 62 cameras per 1,000 people, meaning that Beverly Hills would finish at #2 in the global ranking if it were listed as a separate entity.</p>
<h2>Surveillance in China</h2>
<p>IHS Markit estimates that as of 2021, there are <strong>over 1 billion</strong> surveillance cameras installed worldwide. The firm also believes that 54% of these cameras are located in China.</p>
<p>Because of limited transparency, it’s impossible to pinpoint how many cameras are actually in each Chinese city. However, if we assume that China has 540 million cameras and divide that amongst its population of 1.46 billion, we can reasonably say that there are 373 cameras per 1,000 people (figures rounded).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Cameras-per-1000-people-in-China.jpg" alt="Cameras in China" width="820" height="401" srcset="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Cameras-per-1000-people-in-China.jpg 820w, https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Cameras-per-1000-people-in-China-768x376.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px"/></p>
<p>A limitation of this approach is that it assumes everyone in China lives in a city, which is far from reality. The most recent World Bank figures suggest that 37% of China’s population is rural, which equates to over 500 million people.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the number of cameras per 1,000 people in a <a href="https://www.chinacheckup.com/city-tier/tier-1-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tier 1+ Chinese city</a> (e.g. Shanghai) is likely far greater than 373.</p>
<h2>More About China</h2>
<p>China’s expansive use of cameras and facial recognition technology has been widely documented in the media. These networks enable the country’s <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-game-of-life-visualizing-chinas-social-credit-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social credit program</a>, which gives local governments an unprecedented amount of oversight over its citizens.</p>
<p>For example, China’s camera networks can be used to verify ATM withdrawals, permit access into homes, and even publicly shame people for minor offences like jaywalking.</p>
<p>This might sound like a dystopian nightmare to Western audiences, but according to Chinese citizens, it’s mostly a good thing. In a 2018 survey of 2,209 citizens, <strong>80%</strong> of respondents approved of social credit systems.</p>
