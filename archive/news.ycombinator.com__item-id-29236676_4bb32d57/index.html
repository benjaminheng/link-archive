Do not live in a common law state. You will very likely regret it immensely.<p>If I had been legally married to my ex - I would’ve been raked over the coals. I could see myself being the man on that rig. She contributed nothing to our relationship (financially or emotionally) and I put her through college while she didn’t work or pay for anything. Yet, even if I showed such selflessness, she would’ve gone to court to get half my savings I slaved over and then demand alimony for all eternity. Only because she knew she could. I think once you give people power - they will use it as much as they possibly can even if it is completely unjust. Power corrupts…</p><p>The legal and cultural institution of marriage is ridiculous. Don’t do it! And definitely don’t be with someone who doesn’t work or is a project. It’s miserable (because they become entitled and lack gratefulness).</p><p>It has left me feeling quite scared even if I didn’t go through the toughest parts. I’m overall feeling unable to trust women romantically. After it - I really feel like I’m taking off the rose colored glasses and seeing how poorly I’ve been treated by so many. I’ve stopped feeling like I’m the problem - after all, no one ever said I was. I’ve been the harshest critic of myself. Anyway - don’t get a project car for a partner. They don’t deserve you.

I out-earned my spouse by 4x and lost everything when she decided she wasn&#39;t happy.
Do not expect any gratitude : You have no idea who your ex-wife until you meet her in family court.<p>My ex wife took half of our (my) assets (including my 401k).</p><p>The lawyers took what was left as I was fighting to prevent her from moving away 3&#39;000 miles with our kids (I had to pay for both her and my lawyer)
In the end my ex wife won her move away.
I lost my kids and I am now stuck paying more than half my salary in child support + child support add-ons such as private school, nannies, healthcare.
The remaining of my salary is spent on travel across the country once a month to be able to see my kids.</p><p>It is a very risk bet... you don&#39;t have much to win and a lot to loose if you are a men (custody) and the higher earner.

Yes, marriage comes with a great deal of risk, because it is codifying your love. Love itself is risk, though. As C.S. Lewis said:</p><p>&gt; To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.</p><p>Yes, marriage opens yourself up to a great deal of potential financial damage. It also opens yourself up to a secure romance and friendship, where you can build a future based on commitment to one another. I far prefer to give my wife not just my love and companionship, but also my commitment, my future, and yes, my money. She does the same for me, and it is far more secure and stable than just a dating relationship which could end at any time for any reason. Divorce is way harder to go through than a simple breakup, for either party. Just the sheer effort of a divorce gives you stability, regardless of social, legal, and cultural implications.

It’s not a picnic but it’s not purgatory either.<p>If you were fortunate enough to marry a similarly earning woman then congratulations. Unfortunately - those are exceptional for this industry. At least where I am - it is rare to find a woman making $400K+/yr like I am. Even rarer that she’ll continue working after marriage - as many of the women I know who have made it that far end up giving up the gig and leave the husband to climb the rest of the career ladder to make up for the lost income.</p><p>Ultimately - your argument isn’t good. Your argument is “you should get married because getting divorced is so painful!” Why not just avoid divorce altogether?</p><p>I’ve seen enough loveless marriages. I put my fucking partner through college at an elite institution. I’m out well over $100K on that - and I didn’t even marry the woman. You don’t need to be married to support someone or to be giving.</p><p>Your marriage could end at any point. You just live naively thinking it won’t - but it can and it certainly could. There’s nothing stopping your wife from walking out the door and then filing for divorce. All that is different is that she needs to fill out a few forms or get you to pay for a lawyer - and the upside for her is immense. Hugely immense. Your earning for decades and half of your savings.

I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t care to participate in marriage because it is currently an institution that has not allowed itself to be modified to fit couples as they see fit. It is a one-size option and it - unfortunately - does not work for people like myself.<p>If I was to marry - I&#39;d <i>have</i> to marry someone with the same level of income, spending/saving habits, and so forth for the marriage to be &#34;equal&#34; in the eyes of the law. As it stands - I don&#39;t consider that as much of a factor for my relationships because I&#39;m an extremely giving person. However, my willingness to give everything to someone <i>ends</i> when the relationship does. If I choose to not interact with this person anymore then why should I be in their debt until the end of time?</p><p>It&#39;s not worth it. It creates a perverse power incentive for people in the marriage as well. Again - maybe you&#39;re not in that situation but I was making $400K+ and they were making $0 for <i>years.</i> They had no intention of <i>ever</i> working because they knew I could pay for everything. It went from gratefulness in our first year to entitlement by the end of our relationship and had spread like a plague ruining everything. I cannot fathom how much they would feel entitled to if we had been legally married - even if they contributed literally <i>nothing</i>. And I&#39;m dead serious - they didn&#39;t do housework or child raising or anything either - they did nothing and yet there are no absolutely no enforceable protections for people like myself... BESIDES not marrying - which is what I advocate for.</p><p>I advocate for love, support, giving, and so much but it needs to be on your terms. It cannot be on the terms of some archaic  governmental, cultural, and religious institution.

Marriage has positive impacts on children, and that&#39;s why love itself evolved.  However, &#34;marriage&#34; as it stands today from a social and legal standpoints comes with a lots of side things that should not be.  Times have changed in the thousands of years, however, the system is not being adapted with these changes.  The challenges that would have been when the concept of marriage developed (which predates written history) are not the same as the challenges today.<p>I am not against marriage in itself, however, what it means all taken together is in need of adjustment.  And that will happen sooner or later.  The positive impacts on children can continue as the system is refined.  The only question is how many suffer during the transition phase.

Maintain a good routine; friends, hobbies, sport, job, &amp;c.</p><p>Read books about the psychology of love, couples, relationships, breakups, it helps a lot when you figure out that most people are going through the same thing and are getting past it with time. You can also check out stoic philosophers and how to live for and by yourself, you don&#39;t have to take it to the letter but it certainly gives you another point of view.

The issue, as I see it, is that although we have preventive measures and prophylactics and treatments (all imperfect), we do not yet have a culture of responsibility and building such a culture is hard.</p><p>Theoretically we could compensate for the deficiencies of our medicine, through social responsibility. In reality this does not happen. The clearest proof is the behavior of people during the Covid pandemic. Covid Zero was only achieved in a few countries. Human society is not mature enough to be responsible. Monogamy (with regards to STDs) is like social isolation for Covid and has the same strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>In the case of STDs this would mean pervasive use of testing, condoms, dental dams, etc..
Apparently the porn industry gets tested very frequently because for them an STD represents lost income. The general population not so much. When was the last time you heard of someone using a dental dam during a one night stand? It should mean a push for testing from dating apps. It would mean that someone who has an affair should actually warn the cheated partner, instead of waiting for symptoms to appear. These responsible behaviors do not happen, or at least are not as common as they should be.</p><p>As long social responsibility is not a viable solution, the only solution left is developing vaccines. On this side progress is being made, but it is slow.</p><p>If either solution is achieved, the potential for STDs becomes irrelevant in the choice of preferred *gamy.
Note that monogamy is far from foolproof. Cheating happens, a lot. Also you can get infected through means other than sex and then transmit the disease via sex.</p><p>Personally I believe humans do not hate disease enough to care. I support a strategy of genocide against harmful microbes. Nothing less than complete extermination will be satisfactory.

Biological evolution itself depends on spreading of genes.  So the big picture cannot be an evolutionary path where having more than one partner is less optimal, whether for reasons of STD or otherwise*.  Unless it is so bad that had we not picked up on monogamy, the homo sapiens population may have phased out altogether.  Most species are continuing to live by nature, do not follow monogamy and are still thriving.  May be we have increased our average lifespan by mitigating STD via monogamy practices, while the lifespan of animals continues at the baseline.</p><p>* I have read and noted in other comments here that emotional love between men and women lasts for about seven years.  I suspect that nature purposely evolved us this way to keep the parents together when the children are very young, and once children are sufficiently grown up, the parents open themselves up to new partners.</p><p>2. In the modern times, we are more capable of solving such a challenge than we were in the ancient times.  Surely, COVID challenged us, however, we have made it work out overall.  (No disrespect intended for the people who have lost loved ones, suffered on health, finances, or otherwise.)  If monogamy is to be taken out, more precautions would naturally come in to compensate for a negative impact of STD.  We however did not have provisions for such precautions in the ancient times.</p><p>3. Likewise, while the progress for vaccines may be slow, that would not have been if we did not have the practice of monogamy.  In other words, if we were to redesign things for today, we may have worked the optimal solution to be non-monogamy plus vaccines.</p><p>I have more thoughts to write.

I also believe it might have depended on a lot of factors. Maybe some tribes were not near any animal reservoir. Maybe some diseases were transmitted due to injuries while hunting or while butchering meat. And maybe in some cases, this lead to disadvantages during inter-tribe wars. Maybe a infected tribe lost a war, their men killed and the women raped, resulting in infection of the victorious tribe and once symptoms appeared, some spiritually inclined member of the tribe blamed it on punishment for the rapes. I think it&#39;s hard to say for sure what the influence was. Probably the meme of monogamy developed as a set of superstitions initially. I think STDs would have played a role in this early stage.<p>According to (1) at least 3 diseases originate form animal reservoir. Once the meme of Judaism and its fork Christianity (which merges Greek values - ancient Greece and Rome were monogamous) was on the scene it was almost certainly the greatest factor in spreading the meme of monogamy. I think by the time of antiquity, STDs were no longer the main factor in spreading the meme of monogamy. Wikipedia has a nice list of historic or current communities where polygamy was the norm.</p><p>I also find your speculation about the average duration of emotional love, plausible.</p><p>I wholeheartedly agree with 2 with the small note that theoretically we could have had it easier.</p><p>I am not sure I agree with 3. Overall medicine is a very recent development. I am not sure what are the circumstances that would have enabled us to develop science and medicine significantly earlier. Also, not sure if lack of monogamy would motivate research today but probably would to a statistically relevant degree. The relationship the public and the state have with scientific research is complicated and changes over time. There is certainly a claim that there is a link between the rise of dating apps and a rise of STDs. I do not know if there are actual studies to prove this. It may be just speculation and moral panic. Theoretically this uptick might lead to more funds being directed towards finding cures. Heteronormative monogamy definitely played a role in delaying research of treatments for HIV.</p><p>(1)  “Two or three of the major STIs [in humans] have come from animals. We know, for example, that gonorrhoea came from cattle to humans. Syphilis also came to humans from cattle or sheep many centuries ago, possibly sexually”. The most recent and deadliest STI to have crossed the barrier separating humans and animals has been HIV, which humans got from the simian version of the virus in chimpanzees. <a href="https://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/news/staff-blog/sti-day/" rel="nofollow">https://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/news/staff-bl...</a>

My expectations would be that the needed medical developments for STD would also come by soon like the developments against COVID, though with the unwarranted transitory losses.  If we are in agreement on that, we can consider a slower version where non-monogamy gains grounds over the next few decades.  I think that will happen.

I can just assume that it is in my future if I pursue certain kinds of relationships. 30-50% of marriages fail (the lower bound being more applicable when removing teenagers and military), and marriage contracts have shitty conditions to them. It would be a shitty contract with shitty probabilities even if only 5-10% of them failed, thats a high risk for anything with any financial component.</p><p>So I can just assume that I&#39;ll periodically file some stuff that lawyers ask for, just as a routine matter with no expectation of benefit from the legal system.</p><p>But it doesn&#39;t have to cause me any mental consternation or stress, because it isn&#39;t unexpected.</p><p>Would that approach have helped you?

E.g., keep finances strictly separate.</p><p>* Read &#39;good&#39; books on how all this works, like on psychology of love relationships, parenting, divorce, etc.</p><p>* Need timely action as and when it is becoming bad and timely quitting.  Don&#39;t go by the common guidance received which rests on inexperience and biases.  Look at the statsistics and make good judgment calls.  I have come across books on this too.  Books sometimes give better advise than professional help (whether psychologists or lawyers) as the book author has no more ongoing vested interest once the book is sold.</p><p>In a nutshell, love yourself more than your life partner, and don&#39;t let your judgment be clouded.  Read good books to build your judgment from the experiences of others.

So the question you have is not really applicable.<p>Notes on why one can&#39;t just &#39;not care&#39; for mental health:</p><p>* Prior to separation, it could not be ignored as it used to happen nearly daily, which for me involved her beating herself up badly, shouting at the max of her voice, with my child also seeing all that and feeling helpless.  Those around and the lawyers told me that if the wife makes any false allegation against me, I&#39;ll be doomed for a long time.  And it has ultimately gone that route.  (One should not ideally let it get this bad, exit timely, etc., however it is not that straightforward in practice.)</p><p>* With the lawsuits going on, there is a <i>lot</i> of work involved.  It&#39;s more than a fulltime job in itself along with the usual fulltime job.  This is because the wife just makes random false claims, which does not even require them to think.  It&#39;s the defendent who has to research and file documents to show that she is making lies.  Even with no expectation of benefit from the legal system, it needs to be done anyways as the situation would only be worse if not done.  While in theory it&#39;s &#39;innocent until proven guilty&#39;, that does not mean in practice that the hard work is before the wife.  The hard work is still before the husband.  So even if you try to, you cannot ignore the legal work that continues and brings functional stress.</p><p>* There is a moral responsibility towards the welfare of the child.  So just letting go does not fit.</p><p>* I see many men give up.  They yield to the unjust and frivolous demands of the wife to avoid the above stresses.  Giving up encourages more women and their unscrupolous lawyers to do the same, which would go on to make lives of other people worse.  Hence, there is a moral responsibility to keep trying hard for justice for sake of others as well.</p><p>* Even if one is able to mentally let go of what is happening, there are things missing from life, which I sorely miss.  Psychology research only says that it&#39;s very tough and leads to depression, etc.  I have myself read a lot besides having professional help.  If someone were to ask me &#34;If you know and understand so much, are wise, how come you are <i>still</i> in so much pain?&#34;, my answer, because even the theory says so.  Not easy to circumvent the theory!</p><p>* And so on.

                  <p><span>Sorry that you are going through this. Kids are super smart and can sense the energy very quickly. If mommy and daddy aren’t happy together, the kids will know, no matter how much you try to hide it. Also, if the parents aren’t getting along ..that isn’t a model of a good healthy relationship for the kids to experience either. Kids just need love and affection to grow into healthy and happy individuals. That love and care can exist even if the parents separated. Plus, you should choose yourself and your happiness too instead of compromising. Expecting nothing for the rest of your life isn’t a good value to pass on to your kids. Kids will like you and respect you more once they grow up if you choose yourself and your happiness! I totally understand that it’s important to give your level best to make it work and it’s an extremely tough decision to make, I am just trying to provide a different perspective. IMHO modeling healthy loving relationships is extremely important for the kids to witness as well. Wish you the best!</span></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p><span>Well said. I’m a decade past my divorce and it still causes anguish. I have two kids and while I play by the rules and encourage the kids to be close to both myself and their mother. Their mom is on man in her life number 6/husband 2. There was a period of time that she told the kids to call me dad and the step dad “super dad”. She nearly ran me over twice without warning as I jogged. 
I’ve never contested child support audits despite my income halving recently. Even knowing what I went through I’m not sure I would have made a different choice. My main worry is my kids and making sure they are ok is pretty much the reason I wake up in the morning. I certainly don’t claim to be blameless in the divorce but having my ex and her mothers psychiatrist break protocol and tell me without charging me that I should leave along with refusing to see them anymore raised some flags. Mental illness got worse
From there.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I was simply pointing out observations counter to the assertion that men categorically have it worse in divorce, and did not come to a conclusion in either direction. There is too much gender based vitriol in general in these situations. The truth is there are sociopathic, selfish, narcissistic, etc people of both genders and ultimately that callous quality is the salient one in the cases I’ve seen, not gender.</span></p></div></td></tr>

But also tobacco farmers in Virginia, Cavaliers, and Scotch-Irish and border English in the South, and the Spanish Catholic settlers in California and Florida. Incidentally the first European settlement of the US was Spanish Catholics. And then of course waves of primarily Catholic immigrants from Europe in the 1920s and the current wave of primarily Catholic immigrants from Latin America.</p><p>It might be interesting to note that historically the U.S. was viewed (by Europeans) as a corrupt, lawless country, made wealthy by enormous land/person ratios. It was only after WW1 that the U.S. began to flex its economic power but it still maintained a &#34;gangster&#34; reputation, and in fact was the home of many world famous gangsters and scoundrels, together with grifting machine politics in all the major urban cities from Boston&#39;s Irish machine that gave us the Kennedy dynasty to Huey Long&#39;s machine in the South and virtually everything in between. <i>Puritan</i> was simply not the first word that came to mind in any meaningful description of the U.S. dating from the 19th century onwards.

We could also find no evidence of a difference between the N95 and other types of masks but the trials comparing the two had not been carried in aerosol-generating procedures.</p><p>&gt; But what of the folk walking down the road, going to the supermarket or watching the ducks in the pond?</p><p>&gt; The answer is simple: we do not know.</p><p>From[3]:</p><p>&gt; Unlike other studies looking at masks, the Danmask study was a randomised controlled trial – making it the highest quality scientific evidence.</p><p>&gt; In the end, there was no statistically significant difference between those who wore masks and those who did not when it came to being infected by Covid-19.</p><p>&gt; When it comes to masks, it appears there is still little good evidence they prevent the spread of airborne diseases. The results of the Danmask-19 trial mirror other reviews into influenza-like illnesses.</p><p>&gt; But overall, there is a troubling lack of robust evidence on face masks and Covid-19.</p><p>They go on but I think that&#39;s enough, even for someone who appears to <i>abhor</i> research as much as you.
