							<h2>About This Hardware</h2>
							<h2>Remote Play Anywhere</h2><p>Play your Steam games on your phone, tablet, TV, or other PC using Steam Link. With touch control schemes newly-optimized for hundreds of top titles, you can now access and play games from your PC while on the couch, or on the go.<br/><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay_hub?snr=1_14_1581__remote-play-hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Many Steam games</a> are already optimized for your devices.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/353380/extras/steamlink_mobile.png?t=1617990330"/></p><p><strong>Two steps and you&#39;re in</strong></p><ul><li>Install Steam Link from your favorite app store<br/></li><li>Connect to your PC that&#39;s running Steam and you&#39;re ready to play!</li></ul><p><strong>Just add internet</strong><br/>Using Steam Link, you can connect to any computer that’s running Steam - either on a local network or over the internet. For best performance, use 5G, WiFi or a wired ethernet connection.</p><p><strong>Take control</strong><br/>Many popular Bluetooth controllers including the Steam Controller are compatible with Steam Link and your devices. Or just use the built-in touchscreen controls.</p><p><strong>Behind the scenes</strong><br/>Steam Link is designed to take advantage of the horsepower you already have in your home, streaming from your current gaming computer by mirroring its experience to your device. Video and audio data is sent from your computer to Steam Link, while your controller input is sent back in real time.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/353380/extras/steamlink_together.png?t=1617990330"/></p><h2>Remote Play Together</h2><p>Steam Link now supports Remote Play Together as well! Any Steam player can invite anyone else with the Steam Link app to join in their game.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul><li>The <strong>host </strong>starts up the game on Steam<br/></li><li>Using the Friends list (right click on a friend) or the in-game overlay (shift-tab), <strong>invite your friends</strong>.<br/></li><li>The friend accepts the invite, and that’s it!</li></ul><p><strong>Stream with friends</strong><br/>Using Remote Play Together, you’ll stream video, audio, and voice between players while using your own controllers. You can even share the keyboard and mouse. And while you’re playing, all your voice chat and game volume options are available in one place.</p><p><strong>All the devices, all the fun</strong><br/>Just like Remote Play Anywhere - all the person joining the game needs is a device, the Steam Link App, and an internet connection - not even a Steam account is required. That means I can join from my PC, phone, or tablet, at home or on the go.</p><p><strong>Strictly fun</strong><br/>To keep things simple, only the game is displayed to your Friends, never your desktop or other Top Secret stuff. You can share — or limit access to — the keyboard and mouse. It’s your choice.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/353380/extras/steamlink_tablet.png?t=1617990330"/></p><h2>Remote Play Technology</h2><p>Steam Link is powered by Remote Play technologies, which deliver real-time video encoding over a custom low-latency network protocol.</p><p>When you play a game using Remote Play, video and audio are sent from your gaming PC to another device. Remote input and multiplayer voice are sent back to the gaming PC, all within milliseconds.</p><p>You can tune streaming resolution and bitrate for the best experience on your setup with Advanced Settings. Over a 5 GHz network, our target is a resolution of 1080p at 60 frames per second, with good quality for most scenes. If you have a powerful gaming rig, a wired network, and a capable client device, it&#39;s possible to stream 4K at 60 FPS.</p><p>For more information about Steam Remote Play, visit <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3629-RIAV-1617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Steam Support</a>.<br/>Have questions, issues or suggestions? <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Join the conversation</a> in our discussion forums.</p><h2>Legacy Hardware</h2><p>Steam Link is a solution for extending your Steam games library to any room of the house via your home network.
